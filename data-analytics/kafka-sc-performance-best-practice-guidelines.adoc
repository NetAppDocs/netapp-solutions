This page describes the best practices for improving performance in this solution.

* For ONTAP, when possible, use a GET size >=1MB.
* Increasing `num.network.threads` and `num.io.threads` in `server.properties` on broker nodes enables you to push increased tiering activity to S3 tier. These results are with `num.network.threads` and `num.io.threads` set to 32.
* S3 buckets should target eight constituents per member aggregate.
* Ethernet links driving S3 traffic should use an MTU of 9k when possible on both storage and client.
