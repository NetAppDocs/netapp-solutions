Apache Kafka is a community-distributed event-streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Initially conceived as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on an abstraction of a distributed commit log. Since it was created and open-sourced by LinkedIn in 2011, Kafka has evolved from a messages queue to a full-fledged event-streaming platform. Confluent delivers the distribution of Apache Kafka with the Confluent Platform. The Confluent Platform supplements Kafka with additional community and commercial features designed to enhance the streaming experience of both operators and developers in production at a massive scale.

This document describes the best-practice guidelines for using Confluent Tiered Storage on a NetApp’s Object storage offering by providing the following content:

* Confluent verification with NetApp Object storage – NetApp StorageGRID
*	Tiered storage performance tests
*	Best-practice guidelines for Confluent on NetApp storage systems

== Why Confluent Tiered Storage?

Confluent has become the default real-time streaming platform for many applications, especially for big data, analytics, and streaming workloads. Tiered Storage enables users to separate compute from storage in the Confluent platform. It makes storing data more cost effective, enables you to store virtually infinite amounts of data and scale workloads up (or down) on-demand, and makes administrative tasks like data and tenant rebalancing easier. S3 compatible storage systems can take advantage of all these capabilities to democratize data with all events in one place, eliminating the need for complex data engineering. For more info on why you should use tiered storage for Kafka, check link:https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/tiered-storage.html#netapp-object-storage[this article by Confluent^].

== Why NetApp StorageGRID for tiered storage?

StorageGRID is an industry-leading object storage platform by NetApp. StorageGRID is a software-defined, object-based storage solution that supports industry-standard object APIs, including the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) API. StorageGRID stores and manages unstructured data at scale to provide secure, durable object storage. Content is placed in the right location, at the right time, and on the right storage tier, optimizing workflows and reducing costs for globally distributed rich media.

The greatest differentiator for StorageGRID is its Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) policy engine that enables policy-driven data lifecycle management. The policy engine can use metadata to manage how data is stored across its lifetime to initially optimize for performance and automatically optimize for cost and durability as data ages.

== Enabling Confluent Tiered Storage

The basic idea of tiered storage is to separate the tasks of data storage from data processing. With this separation, it becomes much easier for the data storage tier and the data processing tier to scale independently.

A tiered storage solution for Confluent must contend with two factors. First, it must work around or avoid common object store consistency and availability properties, such as inconsistencies in LIST operations and occasional object unavailability. Secondly, it must correctly handle the interaction between tiered storage and Kafka’s replication and fault tolerance model, including the possibility of zombie leaders continuing to tier offset ranges. NetApp Object storage provides both the consistent object availability and HA model make the tired storage available to tier offset ranges. NetApp object storage provides consistent object availability and an HA model to make the tired storage available to tier offset ranges.

With tiered storage, you can use high-performance platforms for low-latency reads and writes near the tail of your streaming data, and you can also use cheaper, scalable object stores like NetApp StorageGRID for high-throughput historical reads. We also have technical solution for Spark with netapp storage controller and details are here. The following figure shows how Kafka fits into a real-time analytics pipeline.
