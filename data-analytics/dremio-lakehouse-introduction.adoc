In this document, we discuss the deployment details of Dremio with different sources of data from NetApp storage controllers, including ONTAP S3, NAS, and storageGRID. During the deployment, we utilized the TPC-DS benchmarking tool to execute 99 SQL queries across various sources. The document also explores customer use cases within NetApp, as well as a use case involving an auto parts sales customer.
