This NetApp StorageGRID and Apache Kafka solution is a distributed system designed for streams, and both programs are horizontally scalable and fault tolerant. They provide a commit log and allow distributed data streaming and stream processing. NetApp storage arrays decouple compute and data storages resources so that they can be scaled independently. The following figure depicts the NetApp StorageGRID and Confluent Kafka solution.
