The world of analytics and data science touches multiple disciplines in IT and business:

* The data scientist needs the flexibility to use their tools and libraries of choice.
* The data engineer needs to know how the data flows and where it resides.
* A DevOps engineer needs the tools to integrate new AI and ML applications into their CI and CD pipelines.
* Cloud administrators and architects must be able to set up and manage hybrid cloud resources.
* Business users want to have access to analytics, AI, ML, and DL applications.

In this technical report, we describe how NetApp AFF, E-Series, StorageGRID, NFS direct access, Apache Spark, Horovod, and Keras help each of these roles bring value to business.
