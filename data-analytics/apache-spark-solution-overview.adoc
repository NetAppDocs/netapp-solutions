This document focuses on the Apache Spark architecture, customer use cases, and the NetApp storage portfolio related to big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). It also presents various testing results using industry-standard AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) tools against a typical Hadoop system so that you can choose the appropriate Spark solution. To begin, you need a Spark architecture, appropriate components, and two deployment modes (cluster and client).

This document also provides customer use cases to address configuration issues, and it discusses an overview of the NetApp storage portfolio relevant to big data analytics and AI, ML, and DL with Spark. We then finish with testing results derived from Spark-specific use cases and the NetApp Spark solution portfolio.

== Customer challenges

This section focuses on customer challenges with big data analytics and AI/ML/DL in data growth industries such as retail, digital marketing, banking, discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing, government, and professional services. 

=== Unpredictable performance

Traditional Hadoop deployments typically use commodity hardware. To improve performance, you must tune the network, operating system, Hadoop cluster, ecosystem components such as Spark, and hardware. Even if you tune each layer, it can be difficult to achieve desired performance levels because Hadoop is running on commodity hardware that was not designed for high performance in your environment.

=== Media and node failures

Even under normal conditions, commodity hardware is prone to failure. If one disk on a data node fails, the Hadoop master by default considers that node to be unhealthy. It then copies specific data from that node over the network from replicas to a healthy node. This process slows down the network packets for any Hadoop jobs. The cluster must then copy the data back again and remove the over- replicated data when the unhealthy node returns to a healthy state.

=== Hadoop vendor lock-in

Hadoop distributors have their own Hadoop distribution with their own versioning, which locks in the customer to those distributions. However, many customers require support for in-memory analytics that does not tie the customer to specific Hadoop distributions. They need the freedom to change distributions and still bring their analytics with them.

=== Lack of support for more than one language

Customers often require support for multiple languages in addition to MapReduce Java programs to run their jobs. Options such as SQL and scripts provide more flexibility for getting answers, more options for organizing and retrieving data, and faster ways of moving data into an analytics framework.

=== Difficulty of use

For some time, people have complained that Hadoop is difficult to use. Even though Hadoop has become simpler and more powerful with each new version, this critique has persisted. Hadoop requires that you understand Java and MapReduce programming patterns, a challenge for database administrators and people with traditional scripting skill sets.

=== Complicated frameworks and tools

Enterprises AI teams face multiple challenges. Even with expert data science knowledge, tools and frameworks for different deployment ecosystems and applications might not translate simply from one to another. A data science platform should integrate seamlessly with corresponding big data platforms built on Spark with ease of data movement, reusable models, code out of the box, and tools that support best practices for prototyping, validating, versioning, sharing, reusing, and quickly deploying models to production.

== Why choose NetApp?

NetApp can improve your Spark experience in the following ways:

* NetApp NFS direct access (shown in the figure below) allows customers to run big-data-analytics jobs on their existing or new NFSv3 or NFSv4 data without moving or copying the data. It prevents multiple copies of data and eliminates the need to sync the data with a source.
* More efficient storage and less server replication. For example, the NetApp E-Series Hadoop solution requires two rather than three replicas of the data, and the FAS Hadoop solution requires a data source but no replication or copies of data. NetApp storage solutions also produce less server-to-server traffic.
* Better Hadoop job and cluster behavior during drive and node failure.
* Better data-ingest performance.

For example, in the financial and healthcare sector, the movement of data from one place to another must meet legal obligations, which is not an easy task. In this scenario, NetApp NFS direct access analyzes the financial and healthcare data from its original location. Another key benefit is that using NetApp NFS direct access simplifies protecting Hadoop data by using native Hadoop commands and enabling data protection workflows with the rich data management portfolio from NetApp.  

NetApp NFS direct access provides two kinds of deployment options for Hadoop/Spark clusters:

* By default, Hadoop or Spark clusters use the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for data storage and the default file system. NetApp NFS direct access can replace the default HDFS with NFS storage as the default file system, enabling direct analytics on NFS data.
* In another deployment option, NetApp NFS direct access supports configuring NFS as additional storage along with HDFS in a single Hadoop or Spark cluster. In this case, the customer can share data through NFS exports and access it from the same cluster along with HDFS data.

The key benefits of using NetApp NFS direct access include the following:

* Analyzing the data from its current location, which prevents the time- and performance-consuming task of moving analytics data to a Hadoop infrastructure such as HDFS.
* Reducing the number of replicas from three to one.
* Enabling users to decouple compute and storage to scale them independently.
* Providing enterprise data protection by leveraging the rich data management capabilities of ONTAP.
* Certification with the Hortonworks data platform.
* Enabling hybrid data analytics deployments.
* Reducing backup time by leveraging dynamic multithread capability.

The following sections describe storage capabilities that are important for Spark customers.

=== Storage tiering

With Hadoop storage tiering, you can store files with different storage types in accordance with a storage policy. Storage types include `hot`, `cold`, `warm`, `all_ssd`, `one_ssd`, and `lazy_persist`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We performed validation of Hadoop storage tiering on a NetApp AFF storage controller and an E-Series storage controller with SSD and SAS drives with different storage policies. The Spark cluster with AFF-A800 has four compute worker nodes, whereas the cluster with E-Series has eight. This is mainly to compare the performance of solid-state drives (SSDs) versus hard-drive disks (HDDs).

The following figure shows the performance of NetApp solutions for a Hadoop SSD.

* The baseline NL-SAS configuration used eight compute nodes and 96 NL-SAS drives. This configuration generated 1TB of data in 4 minutes and 38 seconds.  See https://www.netapp.com/media/16420-tr-3969.pdf[TR-3969 NetApp E-Series Solution for Hadoop^] for details on the cluster and storage configuration.
* Using TeraGen, the SSD configuration generated 1TB of data 15.66x faster than the NL-SAS configuration. Moreover, the SSD configuration used half the number of compute nodes and half the number of disk drives (24 SSd drives in total). Based on the job completion time, it was almost twice as fast as the NL-SAS configuration.
* Using TeraSort, the SSD configuration sorted 1TB of data 1138.36 times more quickly than the NL-SAS configuration. Moreover, the SSD configuration used half the number of compute nodes and half the number of disk drives (24 SSd drives in total). Therefore, per drive, it was approximately three times faster than the NL-SAS configuration.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* The takeaway is transitioning from spinning disks to all-flash improves performance. The number of compute nodes was not the bottleneck. With NetApp's all-flash storage, runtime performance scales well.
* With NFS, the data was functionally equivalent to being pooled all together, which can reduce the number of compute nodes depending on your workload. The Apache Spark cluster users do not have to manually rebalance data when changing number of compute nodes.

=== Performance scaling - Scale out

When you need more computation power from a Hadoop cluster in an AFF solution, you can add data nodes with an appropriate number of storage controllers. NetApp recommends starting with four data nodes per storage controller array and increasing the number to eight data nodes per storage controller, depending on workload characteristics.

AFF and FAS are perfect for in-place analytics. Based on computation requirements, you can add node managers, and non-disruptive operations allow you to add a storage controller on demand without downtime. We offer rich features with AFF and FAS, such as NVME media support, guaranteed efficiency, data reduction, QOS, predictive analytics, cloud tiering, replication, cloud deployment, and security. To help customers meet their requirements, NetApp offers features such as file system analytics, quotas, and on-box load balancing with no additional license costs. NetApp has better performance in the number of concurrent jobs, lower latency, simpler operations, and higher gigabytes per second throughput than our competitors. Furthermore, NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP runs on all three major cloud providers.

=== Performance scaling - Scale up

Scale-up features allow you to add disk drives to AFF, FAS, and E-Series systems when you need additional storage capacity. With Cloud Volumes ONTAP, scaling storage to the PB level is a combination of two factors: tiering infrequently used data to object storage from block storage and stacking Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses without additional compute.

=== Multiple protocols

NetApp systems support most protocols for Hadoop deployments, including SAS, iSCSI, FCP, InfiniBand, and NFS.
