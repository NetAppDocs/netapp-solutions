This section describes the technology used in this solution.

== NetApp StorageGRID

NetApp StorageGRID is a high-performance, cost-effective object storage platform. By using tiered storage, most of the data on Confluent Kafka, which is stored in local storage or the SAN storage of the broker, is offloaded to the remote object store. This configuration results in significant operational improvements by reducing the time and cost to rebalance, expand, or shrink clusters or replace a failed broker. Object storage plays an important role in managing data that resides on the object store tier, which is why picking the right object storage is important.

StorageGRID offers intelligent, policy-driven global data management using a distributed, node-based grid architecture. It simplifies the management of petabytes of unstructured data and billions of objects through its ubiquitous global object namespace combined with sophisticated data management features. Single-call object access extends across sites and simplifies high availability architectures while ensuring continual object access, regardless of site or infrastructure outages.

Multitenancy allows multiple unstructured cloud and enterprise data applications to be securely serviced within the same grid, increasing the ROI and use cases for NetApp StorageGRID. You can create multiple service levels with metadata-driven object lifecycle policies, optimizing durability, protection, performance, and locality across multiple geographies. Users can adjust data management policies and monitor and apply traffic limits to realign with the data landscape nondisruptively as their requirements change in ever-changing IT environments.

=== Simple management with Grid Manager

The StorageGRID Grid Manager is a browser-based graphical interface that allows you to configure, manage, and monitor your StorageGRID system across globally distributed locations in a single pane of glass.

You can perform the following tasks with the StorageGRID Grid Manager interface:

* Manage globally distributed, petabyte-scale repositories of objects such as images, video, and records.
* Monitor grid nodes and services to ensure object availability.
* Manage the placement of object data over time using information lifecycle management (ILM) rules. These rules govern what happens to an object’s data after it is ingested, how it is protected from loss, where object data is stored, and for how long.
* Monitor transactions, performance, and operations within the system.

=== Information Lifecycle Management policies

StorageGRID has flexible data management policies that include keeping replica copies of your objects and using EC (erasure coding) schemes like 2+1 and 4+2 (among others) to store your objects, depending on specific performance and data protection requirements. As workloads and requirements change over time, it’s common that ILM policies must change over time as well. Modifying ILM policies is a core feature, allowing StorageGRID customers to adapt to their ever-changing environment quickly and easily. Please check the link:https://www.netapp.tv/player/26128/stream?assetType=movies[ILM policy^] and link:https://www.netapp.tv/player/25548/stream?assetType=movies[ILM rules^] setup in StorageGRID.

=== Performance

StorageGRID scales performance by adding more storage nodes, which can be VMs, bare metal, or purpose-built appliances like the link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/7931-ds-3613.pdf[SG5712, SG5760, SG6060, or SGF6024^]. In our tests, we exceeded the Apache Kafka key performance requirements with a minimum-sized, three-node grid using the SGF6024 appliance. As customers scale their Kafka cluster with additional brokers, they can add more storage nodes to increase performance and capacity.

=== Load balancer and endpoint configuration

Admin nodes in StorageGRID provide the Grid Manager UI (user interface) and REST API endpoint to view, configure, and manage your StorageGRID system, as well as audit logs to track system activity. To provide a highly available S3 endpoint for Confluent Kafka tiered storage, we implemented the StorageGRID load balancer, which runs as a service on admin nodes and gateway nodes. In addition, the load balancer also manages local traffic and talks to the GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) to help with disaster recovery.

To further enhance endpoint configuration, StorageGRID provides traffic classification policies built into the admin node, lets you monitor your workload traffic, and applies various quality-of-service (QoS) limits to your workloads. Traffic classification policies are applied to endpoints on the StorageGRID Load Balancer service for gateway nodes and admin nodes. These policies can assist with traffic shaping and monitoring.

=== Traffic classification in StorageGRID

StorageGRID has built-in QoS functionality. Traffic classification policies can help monitor different types of S3 traffic coming from a client application. You can then create and apply policies to put limits on this traffic based on in/out bandwidth, the number of read/write concurrent requests, or the read/write request rate.

== Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a framework implementation of a software bus using stream processing written in Java and Scala. It’s aimed to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Kafka can connect to an external system for data export and import through Kafka Connect and provides Kafka streams, a Java stream processing library. Kafka uses a binary,  TCP-based protocol that is optimized for efficiency and relies on a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together to reduce the overhead of the network roundtrip. This enables larger sequential disk operations, larger network packets, and contiguous memory blocks, thereby enabling Kafka to turn a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes. The following figure depicts the basic data flow of Apache Kafka.

image:confluent-kafka-image5.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

Kafka stores key-value messages that come from an arbitrary number of processes called producers. The data can be partitioned into different partitions within different topics. Within a partition, messages are strictly ordered by their offsets (the position of a message within a partition) and indexed and stored together with a timestamp. Other processes called consumers can read messages from partitions. For stream processing, Kafka offers the Streams API that allows writing Java applications that consume data from Kafka and write results back to Kafka. Apache Kafka also works with external stream processing systems such as Apache Apex, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Apache Storm, and Apache NiFi.

Kafka runs on a cluster of one or more servers (called brokers), and the partitions of all topics are distributed across the cluster nodes. Additionally, partitions are replicated to multiple brokers. This architecture allows Kafka to deliver massive streams of messages in a fault-tolerant fashion and has allowed it to replace some of the conventional messaging systems like Java Message Service (JMS), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and so on. Since the 0.11.0.0 release, Kafka offers transactional writes, which provide exactly once stream processing using the Streams API.

Kafka supports two types of topics: regular and compacted. Regular topics can be configured with a retention time or a space bound. If there are records that are older than the specified retention time or if the space bound is exceeded for a partition, Kafka is allowed to delete old data to free storage space. By default, topics are configured with a retention time of 7 days, but it's also possible to store data indefinitely. For compacted topics, records don't expire based on time or space bounds. Instead, Kafka treats later messages as updates to older message with the same key and guarantees never to delete the latest message per key. Users can delete messages entirely by writing a so-called tombstone message with the null value for a specific key.

There are five major APIs in Kafka:

* *Producer API.* Permits an application to publish streams of records.
* *Consumer API.* Permits an application to subscribe to topics and processes streams of records.
* *Connector API.* Executes the reusable producer and consumer APIs that can link the topics to the existing applications.
* *Streams API.* This API converts the input streams to output and produces the result.
* *Admin API.* Used to manage Kafka topics, brokers and other Kafka objects.

The consumer and producer APIs build on top of the Kafka messaging protocol and offer a reference implementation for Kafka consumer and producer clients in Java. The underlying messaging protocol is a binary protocol that developers can use to write their own consumer or producer clients in any programming language. This unlocks Kafka from the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ecosystem. A list of available non-Java clients is maintained in the Apache Kafka wiki.

=== Apache Kafka use cases

Apache Kafka is most popular for messaging, website activity tracking, metrics, log aggregation, stream processing, event sourcing, and commit logging.

*	Kafka has improved throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault-tolerance, which makes it a good solution for large-scale message-processing applications.
*	Kafka can rebuild a user's activities (page views, searches) in a tracking pipeline as a set of real-time publish-subscribe feeds.
*	Kafka is often used for operational monitoring data. This involves aggregating statistics from distributed applications to produce centralized feeds of operational data.
*	Many people use Kafka as a replacement for a log aggregation solution. Log aggregation typically collects physical log files off of servers and puts them in a central place (for example, a file server or HDFS) for processing. Kafka abstracts files details and provides a cleaner abstraction of log or event data as a stream of messages. This allows for lower-latency processing and easier support for multiple data sources and distributed data consumption.
*	Many users of Kafka process data in processing pipelines consisting of multiple stages, in which raw input data is consumed from Kafka topics and then aggregated, enriched, or otherwise transformed into new topics for further consumption or follow-up processing. For example, a processing pipeline for recommending news articles might crawl article content from RSS feeds and publish it to an "articles" topic. Further processing might normalize or deduplicate this content and publish the cleansed article content to a new topic, and a final processing stage might attempt to recommend this content to users. Such processing pipelines create graphs of real-time data flows based on the individual topics.
*	Event souring is a style of application design for which state changes are logged as a time-ordered sequence of records. Kafka's support for very large stored log data makes it an excellent backend for an application built in this style.
*	Kafka can serve as a kind of external commit-log for a distributed system. The log helps replicate data between nodes and acts as a re-syncing mechanism for failed nodes to restore their data. The log compaction feature in Kafka helps support this use case.

== Confluent

Confluent Platform is an enterprise-ready platform that completes Kafka with advanced capabilities designed to help accelerate application development and connectivity, enable transformations through stream processing, simplify enterprise operations at scale, and meet stringent architectural requirements. Built by the original creators of Apache Kafka, Confluent expands the benefits of Kafka with enterprise-grade features while removing the burden of Kafka management or monitoring. Today, over 80% of the Fortune 100 are powered by data streaming technology – and most of those use Confluent.

=== Why Confluent?

By integrating historical and real-time data into a single, central source of truth, Confluent makes it easy to build an entirely new category of modern, event-driven applications, gain a universal data pipeline, and unlock powerful new use cases with full scalability, performance, and reliability.

=== What is Confluent used for?

Confluent Platform lets you focus on how to derive business value from your data rather than worrying about the underlying mechanics, such as how data is being transported or integrated between disparate systems. Specifically, Confluent Platform simplifies connecting data sources to Kafka, building streaming applications, as well as securing, monitoring, and managing your Kafka infrastructure. Today, Confluent Platform is used for a wide array of use cases across numerous industries, from financial services, omnichannel retail, and autonomous cars, to fraud detection, microservices, and IoT.

The following figure shows Confluent Kafka Platform components.

=== Overview of Confluent’s event streaming technology

At the core of Confluent Platform is https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka^], the most popular open-source distributed streaming platform. The key capabilities of Kafka are as follows:

* Publish and subscribe to streams of records.
* Store streams of records in a fault tolerant way.
* Process streams of records.

Out of the box, Confluent Platform also includes Schema Registry, REST Proxy, a total of 100+ prebuilt Kafka connectors, and ksqlDB.

=== Overview of Confluent platform’s enterprise features

* *Confluent Control Center.* A GUI-based system for managing and monitoring Kafka. It allows you to easily manage Kafka Connect and to create, edit, and manage connections to other systems.
* *Confluent for Kubernetes.* Confluent for Kubernetes is a Kubernetes operator. Kubernetes operators extend the orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes by providing the unique features and requirements for a specific platform application. For Confluent Platform, this includes greatly simplifying the deployment process of Kafka on Kubernetes and automating typical infrastructure lifecycle tasks.
* *Confluent connectors to Kafka.* Connectors use the Kafka Connect API to connect Kafka to other systems such as databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems. Confluent Hub has downloadable connectors for the most popular data sources and sinks, including fully tested and supported versions of these connectors with Confluent Platform. More details can be found https://docs.confluent.io/home/connect/userguide.html[here^].
* *Self- balancing clusters.* Provides automated load balancing, failure detection and self-healing. It provides support for adding or decommissioning brokers as needed, with no manual tuning.
* *Confluent cluster linking.* Directly connects clusters together and mirrors topics from one cluster to another over a link bridge. Cluster linking simplifies setup of multi-datacenter, multi-cluster, and hybrid cloud deployments.
* *Confluent auto data balancer.* Monitors your cluster for the number of brokers, the size of partitions, number of partitions, and the number of leaders within the cluster. It allows you to shift data to create an even workload across your cluster, while throttling rebalance traffic to minimize the effect on production workloads while rebalancing.
* *Confluent replicator.* Makes it easier than ever to maintain multiple Kafka clusters in multiple data centers.
* *Tiered storage.* Provides options for storing large volumes of Kafka data using your favorite cloud provider, thereby reducing operational burden and cost. With tiered storage, you can keep data on cost-effective object storage and scale brokers only when you need more compute resources.
* *Confluent JMS client.* Confluent Platform includes a JMS-compatible client for Kafka. This Kafka client implements the JMS 1.1 standard API, using Kafka brokers as the backend. This is useful if you have legacy applications using JMS and you would like to replace the existing JMS message broker with Kafka.
* *Confluent MQTT proxy.* Provides a way to publish data directly to Kafka from MQTT devices and gateways without the need for a MQTT broker in the middle.
* *Confluent security plugins.* Confluent security plugins are used to add security capabilities to various Confluent Platform tools and products. Currently, there is a plugin available for the Confluent REST proxy that helps to authenticate the incoming requests and propagate the authenticated principal to requests to Kafka. This enables Confluent REST proxy clients to utilize the multitenant security features of the Kafka broker.
