NVA-1157-DEPLOY describes the performance and functionality validation of Apache Spark SQL on NetApp NFS AFF storage systems. It reviews the configuration, architecture, and performance testing based on various scenarios, as well as recommendations for using Spark with NetApp ONTAP data management software. It also covers test results based on just a bunch of disks (JBOD) versus the NetApp AFF A800 storage controller.
