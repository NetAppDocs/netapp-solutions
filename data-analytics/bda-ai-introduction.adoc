This document describes how to move big-data analytics data and HPC data to AI. AI processes NFS data through NFS exports, whereas customers often have their AI data in a big-data analytics platform, such as HDFS, Blob, or S3 storage as well as HPC platforms such as GPFS. This paper provides guidelines for moving big-data-analytics data and HPC data to AI by using NetApp XCP and NIPAM. We also discuss the business benefits of moving data from big data and HPC to AI.

== Concepts and components

=== Big data analytics storage

Big data analytics is the major storage provider for HDFS. A customer often uses a Hadoop-compatible file system (HCFS) such as Windows Azure Blob Storage, MapR File System (MapR-FS), and S3 object storage.

=== General parallel file system

IBMâ€™s GPFS is an enterprise file system that provides an alternative to HDFS. GPFS provides flexibility for applications to decide the block size and replication layout, which provide good performance and efficiency.

=== NetApp In-Place Analytics Module

The NetApp In-Place Analytics Module (NIPAM) serves as a driver for Hadoop clusters to access NFS data. It has four components: a connection pool, an NFS InputStream, a file handle cache, and an NFS OutputStream. For more information, see https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4382.pdf[TR-4382: NetApp In-Place Analytics Module.^]

=== Hadoop Distributed Copy

Hadoop Distributed Copy (DistCp) is a distributed copy tool used for large inter-cluster and intra-cluster coping tasks. This tool uses MapReduce for data distribution, error handling, and reporting. It expands the list of files and directories and inputs them to map tasks to copy the data from the source list. The image below shows the DistCp operation in HDFS and nonHDFS.

Hadoop DistCp moves data between the two HDFS systems without using an additional driver. NetApp provides the driver for non-HDFS systems. For an NFS destination, NIPAM provides the driver to copy data that Hadoop DistCp uses to communicate with NFS destinations when copying data.

== NetApp Cloud Volumes Service

The NetApp Cloud Volumes Service is a cloud-native file service with extreme performance. This service helps customers accelerate their time-to-market by rapidly spinning resources up and down and using NetApp features to improve productivity and reduce staff downtime. The Cloud Volumes Service is the right alternative for disaster recovery and back up to cloud because it reduces the overall data-center footprint and consumes less native public cloud storage.

== NetApp XCP

NetApp XCP is client software that enables fast and reliable any-to-NetApp and NetApp-to-NetApp data migration. This tool is designed to copy a large amount of unstructured NAS data from any NAS system to a NetApp storage controller. The XCP Migration Tool uses a multicore, multichannel I/O streaming engine that can process many requests in parallel, such as data migration, file or directory listings, and space reporting. This is the default NetApp data Migration Tool. You can use XCP to copy data from a Hadoop cluster and HPC to NetApp NFS storage. The diagram below shows data transfer from a Hadoop and HPC cluster to a NetApp NFS volume using XCP.

== NetApp BlueXP Copy and Sync

NetApp BlueXP Copy and Sync is a hybrid data replication software-as-a-service that transfers and synchronizes NFS, S3, and CIFS data seamlessly and securely between on-premises storage and cloud storage. This software is used for data migration, archiving, collaboration, analytics, and more. After data is transferred, BlueXP Copy and Sync continuously syncs the data between the source and destination. Going forward, it then transfers the delta. It also secures the data within your own network, in the cloud, or on premises. This software is based on a pay-as-you-go model, which provides a cost-effective solution and provides monitoring and reporting capabilities for your data transfer.
