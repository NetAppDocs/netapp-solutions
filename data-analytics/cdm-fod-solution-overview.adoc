summary: "Data scientists and engineers often need to access data stored in the NFS format, but accessing this data directly from the S3 protocol in AWS SageMaker can be challenging because AWS only supports S3 bucket access. However, NetApp ONTAP provides a solution by enabling dual-protocol access for NFS and S3. With this solution, data scientists and engineers can access NFS data from AWS SageMaker notebooks via S3 buckets from NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP. This approach enables easy access and sharing of the same data from both NFS and S3 without the need for additional software."
