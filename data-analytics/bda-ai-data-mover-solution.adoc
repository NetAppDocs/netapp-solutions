summary: In a big-data cluster, data is stored in HDFS or HCFS, such as MapR-FS, the Windows Azure Storage Blob, S3, or the Google file system. We performed testing with HDFS, MapR-FS, and S3 as the source to copy data to NetApp ONTAP NFS export with the help of NIPAM by using the hadoop distcp command from the source.

In a big-data cluster, data is stored in HDFS or HCFS, such as MapR-FS, the Windows Azure Storage Blob, S3, or the Google file system. We performed testing with HDFS, MapR-FS, and S3 as the source to copy data to NetApp ONTAP NFS export with the help of NIPAM by using the `hadoop distcp` command from the source.

The following diagram illustrates the typical data movement from a Spark cluster running with HDFS storage to a NetApp ONTAP NFS volume so that NVIDIA can process AI operations.

The `hadoop distcp` command uses the MapReduce program to copy the data. NIPAM works with MapReduce to act as a driver for the Hadoop cluster when copying data. NIPAM can distribute a load across multiple network interfaces for a single export. This process maximizes the network throughput by distributing the data across multiple network interfaces when you copy the data from HDFS or HCFS to NFS.

[NOTE]
NIPAM is not supported or certified with MapR.
