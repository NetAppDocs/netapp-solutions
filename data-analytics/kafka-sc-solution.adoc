Confluent and NetApp AFF A900 storage controller powered by ONTAP are distributed systems designed for data streams. Both are horizontally scalable, fault tolerant, and provide excellent performance under load. They complement each other in distributed data streaming and stream processing with lower storage costs with data reduction technologies that minimize the data footprint. The AFF A900 storage controller provides great performance, while allowing the decoupling of compute and data storage resources. This simplifies system administration and allows resources to be scaled independently.
