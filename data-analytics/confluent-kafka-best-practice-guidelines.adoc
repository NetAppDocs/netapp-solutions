*	Based on our validation, S3 object storage is best for Confluent to keep data.
*	We can use high-throughput SAN (specifically FC) to keep the broker hot data or local disk, because, in the Confluent tiered storage configuration, the size of the data held in the brokers data directory is based on the segment size and retention time when the data is moved to object storage.
* Object stores provide better performance when segment.bytes is higher; we tested 512MB.
* In Kafka, the length of the key or value (in bytes) for each record produced to the topic is controlled by the `length.key.value` parameter. For StorageGRID, S3 object ingest and retrieve performance increased to higher values. For example, 512 bytes provided a 5.8GBps retrieve, 1024 bytes provided a 7.5GBps s3 retrieve, and 2048 bytes provided close to 10GBps.

The following figure presents the S3 object ingest and retrieve based on `length.key.value`.

*	*Kafka tuning.* To improve the performance of tiered storage, you can increase TierFetcherNumThreads and TierArchiverNumThreads. As a general guideline, you want to increase TierFetcherNumThreads to match the number of physical CPU cores and increase TierArchiverNumThreads to half the number of CPU cores. For example, in server properties, if you have a machine with eight physical cores, set confluent.tier.fetcher.num.threads = 8 and confluent.tier.archiver.num.threads = 4.
*	*Time interval for topic deletes.* When a topic is deleted, deletion of the log segment files in object storage does not immediately begin. Rather, there is a time interval with a default value of 3 hours before deletion of those files takes place. You can modify the configuration, confluent.tier.topic.delete.check.interval.ms, to change the value of this interval. If you delete a topic or cluster, you can also manually delete the objects in the respective bucket.
*	*ACLs on tiered storage internal topics.* A recommended best practice for on-premises deployments is to enable an ACL authorizer on the internal topics used for tiered storage. Set ACL rules to limit access on this data to the broker user only. This secures the internal topics and prevents unauthorized access to tiered storage data and metadata.

NOTE: Replace the user `<kafka>` with the actual broker principal in your deployment.

For example, the command `confluent-tier-state` sets ACLs on the internal topic for tiered storage. Currently, there is only a single internal topic related to tiered storage. The example creates an ACL that provides the principal Kafka permission for all operations on the internal topic.
