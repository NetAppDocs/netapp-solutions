If you have managed a Kafka cluster before, you are likely familiar with the challenges that come with manually reassigning partitions to different brokers to make sure that the workload is balanced across the cluster. For organizations with large Kafka deployments, reshuffling large amounts of data can be daunting, tedious, and risky, especially if mission-critical applications are built on top of the cluster. However, even for the smallest Kafka use cases, the process is time consuming and prone to human error.

In our lab, we tested the Confluent self-balancing clusters feature, which automates rebalancing based on cluster topology changes or uneven load. The Confluent rebalance test helps to measure the time to add a new broker when node failure or the scaling node requires rebalancing data across brokers. In classic Kafka configurations, the amount of data to be rebalanced grows as the cluster grows, but, in tiered storage, rebalancing is restricted to a small amount of data. Based on our validation, rebalancing in tiered storage takes seconds or minutes in a classic Kafka architecture and grows linearly as the cluster grows.

In self-balancing clusters, partition rebalances are fully automated to optimize Kafkaâ€™s throughput, accelerate broker scaling, and reduce the operational burden of running a large cluster. At steady-state, self-balancing clusters monitor the skew of data across the brokers and continuously reassigns partitions to optimize cluster performance. When scaling the platform up or down, self-balancing clusters automatically recognize the presence of new brokers or the removal of old brokers and trigger a subsequent partition reassignment. This enables you to easily add and decommission brokers, making your Kafka clusters fundamentally more elastic. These benefits come without any need for manual intervention, complex math, or the risk of human error that partition reassignments typically entail. As a result, data rebalances are completed in far less time, and you are free to focus on higher-value event-streaming projects rather than needing to constantly supervise your clusters.
