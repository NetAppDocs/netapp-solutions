TR-4623 describes the integrated architecture of the NetApp E-Series and Splunk design. Optimized for node storage balance, reliability, performance, storage capacity, and density, this design employs the Splunk clustered index node model, with higher scalability and lower TCO. Decoupling storage from compute provides the ability to scale each separately, saving the cost of overprovisioning one or the other. In addition, this document summarizes the performance test results obtained from a Splunk machine log event simulation tool.
