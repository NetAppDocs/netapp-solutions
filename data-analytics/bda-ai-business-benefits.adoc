Moving data from big data analytics to AI provides the following benefits:

* The ability to extract data from different Hadoop file systems and GPFS into a unified NFS storage system
* A Hadoop-integrated and automated way to transfer data
* A reduction in the cost of library development for moving data from Hadoop file systems
* Maximum performance by aggregated throughput of multiple network interfaces from a single source of data by using NIPAM
* Scheduled and on-demand methods to transfer data
* Storage efficiency and enterprise management capability for unified NFS data by using ONTAP data management software
* Zero cost for data movement with the Hadoop method for data transfer
