== NetApp StorageGRID as an Object Store Extension
 
NetApp has collaborated with VMware to integrate NetApp StorageGRID into VMware Cloud Director in support of the VMware Sovereign Cloud. This plug-in to VMware Cloud Director enables service providers to use StorageGRID as their object storage offering (regardless of use case) and allows StorageGRID management through the same VMware multi-tenant solution (VMware Cloud Director) used by service providers to manage other parts of their offering catalog. 

Partners that deliver VMware Sovereign Clouds can choose NetApp StorageGRID to help them managed and maintain cloud environments with unstructured data. Its universal compatibility in its native support for industry-standard APIs, like Amazon S3 API, helps ensure smooth interoperability across diverse cloud environments, and unique innovations such as automated lifecycle management helps ensure more cost-effective safeguarding, storage, and long-term preservation of customers’ unstructured data.
 
NetApp’s Sovereign Cloud integration with Cloud Director providers customers with:

* Assurance that sensitive data, including metadata, remains under sovereign control while preventing access by foreign authorities that could violate data privacy laws. 
* Increased security and compliance that protects applications and data from rapidly evolving attack vectors while maintaining continuous compliance with a trusted local. infrastructure, built-in frameworks, and local experts.
* Future-proofed infrastructure to react quickly to changing data privacy regulations, security threats, and geopolitics.
* The ability to unlock the value of data with secure data sharing and analysis to drive innovation without violating privacy laws. Data integrity is protected to ensure accurate insights.
