The NetApp XCP file analytics GUI helps to run file system scans by using XCP at the back end and visualizing statistics such as graphs and views for any NAS (NFS, SMB) file system. Starting in 1.6, XCP can be run as a service with the help of simple deployment steps by using the Configure and systemctl options. The XCP Configure option guides you to install and configure Postgres and a web server as well as collect credentials. The systemctl option runs XCP as a service for REST API communications from the GUI.

The following figure illustrates the XCP file analytics flow.

[NOTE]
For more information about the high-level architecture of XCP file analytics, GUI-based dashboard views such as stats view, and file distribution view details, see the blog post https://blog.netapp.com/xcp-data-migration-software[NetApp XCP 1.6 Delivers Open File Analytics and Infrastructure Improvements^].

There is a limited GUI in XCP 1.6 for customized graphs. To create the required graphs, you can use the CLI to run the `xcp` scan command with matching filters. See the following examples.

. Generate a list of files modified beyond a year by using `xcp scan` and the `-match` filter with the space consumed.
