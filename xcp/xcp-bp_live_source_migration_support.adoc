Live Source Migration support included in XCP 1.7 allows migration from a data source that is in active use (read and write activity). XCP leaves out files that are being used during the migration job,  such as copy and sync running, and skipped files information is captured in the xcp log. 

This feature supports changes on the source but does not support changes on the destination. During migration,  the destination should not be active. Live Source Migration support is only available for NFS migrations. 

[NOTE]
No special settings are required for Live Source Migrations.
