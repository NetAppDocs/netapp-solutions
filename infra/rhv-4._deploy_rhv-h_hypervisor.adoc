This solution employs the recommended self-hosted engine architecture of RHV deployment with the minimum setup (two self-hosted engine nodes). These steps begin after the nodes have been racked and cabled and the IPMI port has been configured on each node for using the console. To deploy the RHV-H hypervisor on HCI compute nodes, complete the following steps:

. Access the out-of-band management console for the compute nodes in the cluster and log in with the default credentials ADMIN/ADMIN.

. Click the Remote Console Preview image in the center of the screen to download a JNLP file launched by Java Web Start, which launches an interactive console to the system.

. After the virtual console launches, attach the RHV-H 4.3.9 ISO by navigating to and clicking Virtual Media > Virtual Storage.

+

image:redhat_virtualization_image33.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. In the Editing VLAN Connection screen, click the IPv4 Settings sub-tab. In the IPv4 Settings sub-tab, configure the network address and the netmask corresponding to the storage network. Click Save to confirm the settings.
+

image:redhat_virtualization_image34.jpg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Confirm that the network interfaces are up and click Done.
+

image:redhat_virtualization_image35.jpg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. After the wizard navigates back to the configuration page, click Begin Installation. The next screen prompts you to configure the root password and optionally to create another user for logging into RHV-H.
+

image:redhat_virtualization_image36.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. After the installation completes, unmount the ISO file by navigating to Virtual media > Virtual Storage in the virtual console and click Plug Out. Then click Reboot on the Anaconda GUI to complete the installation process. The node then reboots.
+

After the node comes up, it displays the login screen.
+

image:redhat_virtualization_image38.jpg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Now that the installation is complete, you must then register RHV-H and enable the required repositories. Open a browser and log in to the Cockpit user interface at `https://<HostFQDN/IP>:9090` using the root credentials provided during the installation.
+

image:redhat_virtualization_image39.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Navigate to localhost > Subscriptions and click Register. Enter your Red Hat Portal username and password, click the check box Connect this System to Red Hat Insights, and click Register. The system automatically subscribes to the Red Hat Virtualization Host entitlement.
+

Red Hat Insights provide continuous analysis of registered systems to proactively recognize threats to availability, security, performance, and stability across physical, virtual, and cloud environments.
+
