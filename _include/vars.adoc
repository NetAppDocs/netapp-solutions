# NFS storage parameters when data_protocol set to NFS. Volume named after Oracle hosts name identified by mount point as follow for oracle DB server 1. Each mount point dedicates to a particular Oracle files: u01 - Oracle binary, u02 - Oracle data, u03 - Oracle redo. Add additional volumes by click on "More NFS volumes" and also add the volumes list to corresponding host_vars as host_datastores_nfs variable. For multiple DB server deployment, additional volumes sets needs to be added for additional DB server. Input variable "{{groups.oracle[1]}}_u01", "{{groups.oracle[1]}}_u02", and "{{groups.oracle[1]}}_u03" as vol_name for second DB server. Place volumes for multiple DB servers alternatingly between controllers for balanced IO performance, e.g. DB server 1 on controller node1, DB server 2 on controller node2 etc. Make sure match lif address with controller node.
