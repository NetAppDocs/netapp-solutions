Enterprises are increasingly adopting DevOps practices to create new products, shorten release cycles, and rapidly add new features. Because of their innate agile nature, containers and microservices play a crucial role in supporting DevOps practices. However, practicing DevOps at a production scale in an enterprise environment presents its own challenges and imposes certain requirements on the underlying infrastructure, such as the following:

* High availability at all layers in the stack

* Ease of deployment procedures

* Non-disruptive operations and upgrades

* API-driven and programmable infrastructure to keep up with microservices agility

* Multitenancy with performance guarantees

* The ability to run virtualized and containerized workloads simultaneously

* The ability to scale infrastructure independently based on workload demands

* AFF and FAS systems run NetApp ONTAP and provide storage for both file-based (NFS) and block-based (iSCSI) use cases.

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP Select provide the same benefits in the cloud and virtual space respectively.

* NetApp Cloud Volumes Service (AWS/GCP) and Azure NetApp Files provide file-based storage in the cloud.

//tag::netapp_overview_page_element[]
* NetApp Element storage systems cover block-based (iSCSI) use cases in a highly scalable environment.
//end::netapp_overview_page_element[]

NOTE: Each storage system in the NetApp portfolio can ease both data management and movement between on-premises sites and the cloud so that your data is where your applications are.

NetApp ONTAP is a powerful storage-software tool with capabilities such as an intuitive GUI, REST APIs with automation integration, AI-informed predictive analytics and corrective action, non-disruptive hardware upgrades, and cross-storage import.

For more information about the NetApp ONTAP storage system, visit the https://www.netapp.com/data-management/ontap-data-management-software/[NetApp ONTAP website^].

ONTAP provides the following features:

* A unified storage system with simultaneous data access and management of NFS, CIFS, iSCSI, FC, FCoE, and FC-NVMe protocols.
* Different deployment models include on-premises on all-flash, hybrid, and all-HDD hardware configurations; VM-based storage platforms on a supported hypervisor such as ONTAP Select; and in the cloud as Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* Increased data storage efficiency on ONTAP systems with support for automatic data tiering, inline data compression, deduplication, and compaction.
* Workload-based, QoS-controlled storage.
* Seamless integration with a public cloud for tiering and protecting data. ONTAP also provides robust data protection capabilities that sets it apart in any environment:

** *NetApp Snapshot copies.* A fast, point-in-time backup of data using a minimal amount of disk space with no additional performance overhead.
** *NetApp SnapMirror.* Mirrors the Snapshot copies of data from one storage system to another. ONTAP supports mirroring data to other physical platforms and cloud-native services as well.
** *NetApp SnapLock.*  Efficiently administration of non-rewritable data by writing it to special volumes that cannot be overwritten or erased for a designated period.
** *NetApp SnapVault.* Backs up data from multiple storage systems to a central Snapshot copy that serves as a backup to all designated systems.
** *NetApp SyncMirror.* Provides real-time, RAID-level mirroring of data to two different plexes of disks that are connected physically to the same controller.
** *NetApp SnapRestore.* Provides fast restoration of backed-up data on demand from Snapshot copies.
** *NetApp FlexClone.* Provides instantaneous provisioning of a fully readable and writeable copy of a NetApp volume based on a Snapshot copy.

For more information about ONTAP, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/index.html[ONTAP 9 Documentation Center^].

NOTE: NetApp ONTAP is available on-premises, virtualized, or in the cloud.

== NetApp platforms

=== NetApp AFF/FAS

NetApp provides robust all-flash (AFF) and scale-out hybrid (FAS) storage platforms that are tailor-made with low-latency performance, integrated data protection, and multi-protocol support.

Both systems are powered by NetApp ONTAP data management software, the industryâ€™s most advanced data-management software for simplified, highly available, cloud-integrated storage management to deliver enterprise-class speed, efficiency, and security for your data fabric needs.

NetApp Astra Control Center can be installed on a {k8s_distribution_name} cluster that has the Astra Trident storage orchestrator deployed and configured with storage classes and storage backends to NetApp ONTAP storage systems.

For more information on Astra Trident, see link:dwn_overview_trident.html[this document here^].

In a cloud-connected environment, Astra Control Center uses Cloud Insights to provide advanced monitoring and telemetry. In the absence of a Cloud Insights connection, limited monitoring and telemetry (seven days worth of metrics) is available and exported to Kubernetes native monitoring tools (Prometheus and Grafana) through open metrics endpoints.

Astra Control Center is fully integrated into the NetApp AutoSupport and Active IQ ecosystem to provide support for users, provide assistance with troubleshooting, and display usage statistics.

In addition to the paid version of Astra Control Center, a 90-day evaluation license is also available. The evaluation version is supported through email and the community Slack channel. Customers have access to these resources, other knowledge-base articles, and documentation available from the in-product support dashboard.

Astra Trident is an open-source, fully supported storage orchestrator for containers and Kubernetes distributions like {k8s_distribution_name}. Trident works with the entire NetApp storage portfolio, including the NetApp ONTAP and Element storage systems, and it also supports NFS and iSCSI connections. Trident accelerates the DevOps workflow by allowing end users to provision and manage storage from their NetApp storage systems without requiring intervention from a storage administrator.

An administrator can configure a number of storage backends based on project needs and storage system models that enable advanced storage features, including compression, specific disk types, or QoS levels that guarantee a certain level of performance. After they are defined, these backends can be used by developers in their projects to create persistent volume claims (PVCs) and to attach persistent storage to their containers on demand.

Astra Trident has a rapid development cycle and, like Kubernetes, is released four times a year.

The latest version of Astra Trident is 22.04 released in April 2022. A support matrix for what version of Trident has been tested with which Kubernetes distribution can be found https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/requirements.html#supported-frontends-orchestrators[here].

Starting with the 20.04 release, Trident setup is performed by the Trident operator. The operator makes large scale deployments easier and provides additional support, including self healing for pods that are deployed as a part of the Trident install.

With the 21.01 release, a Helm chart was made available to ease the installation of the Trident Operator.
