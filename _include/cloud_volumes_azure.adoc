.Terraform configuration files for deployment of ANF Volume on Azure

This section contains various Terraform configuration files to deploy/configure ANF (Azure Netapp Files) Volume on Azure.

Terraform Documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

.Procedure
In order to run the template:

.. Clone the repository.
+
[source, cli]
    git clone https://github.com/NetApp/na_cloud_volumes_automation.git

.. Navigate to the desired folder
+
[source, cli]
    cd na_cloud_volumes_automation

.. Login to your Azure CLI (Azure CLI must be installed).
+
[source, cli]
    az login

.. Update the variable values in `vars/azure_anf.tfvars`.
+
NOTE: You can choose to deploy the ANF volume using an existing vnet and subnet by setting the variable "vnet_creation_bool" and "subnet_creation_bool" value to false and supplying the "subnet_id_for_anf_vol". You can also set those values to true and create a new vnet and subnet in which case, the subnet ID will automatically be taken from the newly created subnet.

.. Initialize the Terraform repository to install all the pre-requisites and prepare for deployment.
+
[source, cli]
    terraform init

.. Verify the terraform files using terraform validate command.
+
[source, cli]
    terraform validate

.. Make a dry run of the configuration to get a preview of all the changes expected by the deployment.
+
[source, cli]
    terraform plan -target="module.anf" -var-file="vars/azure_anf.tfvars"

.. Run the deployment
+
[source, cli]
    terraform apply -target="module.anf" -var-file="vars/azure_anf.tfvars"

To delete the deployment

[source, cli]
  terraform destroy

| *az_netapp_vol_protocol* | String | (Optional) The target volume protocol expressed as a list. Supported single value include `CIFS`, `NFSv3`, or `NFSv4.1`. If argument is not defined it will default to `NFSv3`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created and data will be lost.
| *az_netapp_vol_security_style* | String | (Optional) Volume security style, accepted values are `Unix` or `Ntfs`. If not provided, single-protocol volume is created defaulting to `Unix` if it is `NFSv3` or `NFSv4.1` volume, if `CIFS`, it will default to `Ntfs`. In a dual-protocol volume, if not provided, its value will be `Ntfs`.
| *az_netapp_vol_storage_quota* | String | (Required) The maximum Storage Quota allowed for a file system in Gigabytes.
