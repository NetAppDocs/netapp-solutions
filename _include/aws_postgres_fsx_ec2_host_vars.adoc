# Add your AWS EC2 instance IP address for the respective PostgreSQL server host
ansible_host: "10.61.180.15"

# "{{groups.postgresql[0]}}" represents first PostgreSQL DB server as defined in PostgreSQL hosts group [postgresql]. For concurrent multiple PostgreSQL DB servers deployment, [0] will be incremented for each additional DB server. For example,  "{{groups.posgresql[1]}}" represents DB server 2, "{{groups.posgresql[2]}}" represents DB server 3 ... As a good practice and the default, two volumes are allocated to a PostgreSQL DB server with corresponding /pgdata, /pglogs mount points, which store PostgreSQL data, and PostgreSQL log files respectively. The number and naming of DB volumes allocated to a DB server must match with what is defined in global fsx_vars.yml file by src_db_vols, src_archivelog_vols parameters, which dictates how many volumes are to be created for each DB server. aggr_name is aggr1 by default. Do not change. lif address is the NFS IP address for the SVM where PostgreSQL server is expected to mount its database volumes. Primary site servers from primary SVM and standby servers from standby SVM.
