== Overview: Migrating virtual machines with VMware HCX, NetApp Cloud Volume Service datastores, and Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE)

One of the most common use cases for the Google Cloud VMware Engine and Cloud Volume Service datastore is the migration of VMware workloads. VMware HCX is a preferred option and provides various migration mechanisms to move on-premises virtual machines (VMs) and its data to Cloud Volume Service NFS datastores.

VMware HCX is primarily a migration platform that is designed to simplify application migration, workload rebalancing, and even business continuity across clouds. It is included as part of Google Cloud VMware Engine Private Cloud and offers many ways to migrate workloads and can be used for disaster recovery (DR) operations.  

This document provides step-by-step guidance for provisioning Cloud Volume Service datastore followed by downloading, deploying, and configuring VMware HCX, including all its main components in on-premises and the Google Cloud VMware Engine side including Interconnect, Network Extension, and WAN optimization for enabling various VM migration mechanisms.

[NOTE]
VMware HCX works with any datastore type as the migration is at the VM level. Hence this document is applicable to existing NetApp customers and non-NetApp customers who are planning to deploy Cloud Volume Service with Google Cloud VMware Engine for a cost-effective VMware cloud deployment.

.High-level steps

=====

.Prerequisites
[%collapsible]
=====
Before you begin, make sure the following prerequisites are met. For more information, see this https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/workloads/howto-migrate-vms-using-hcx[link^]. After the prerequisites, including connectivity, are in place, download HCX license key from the Google Cloud VMware Engine portal. After the OVA installer is downloaded, proceed with the installation process as described below.

[NOTE]
HCX advanced is the default option and VMware HCX Enterprise edition is also available through a support ticket and supported at no additional cost. Refer https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/whats-new-with-google-cloud-vmware-engine[this link^]

* Use an existing Google Cloud VMware Engine software-defined data center (SDDC) or create a private cloud by using this https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/ehc/gcp-setup.html[NetApp link^] or this https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/create-private-cloud[Google link^].
* Migration of VMs and associated data from the on-premises VMware vSphere- enabled data center requires network connectivity from the data center to the SDDC environment. Before migrating workloads, https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/networking/howto-connect-to-onpremises[set up a Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect connection^] between the on-premises environment and the respective private cloud.
* The network path from on-premises VMware vCenter Server environment to the Google Cloud VMware Engine private cloud must support the migration of VMs by using vMotion.
* Make sure the required https://ports.esp.vmware.com/home/VMware-HCX[firewall rules and ports^] are allowed for vMotion traffic between the on-premises vCenter Server and SDDC vCenter. 
* Cloud Volume Service NFS volume should be mounted as a datastore in Google Cloud VMware Engine.  Follow the steps detailed in this https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/vmware-ecosystem/howto-cloud-volumes-service-datastores[link^] to attach Cloud Volume Service datastores to Google Cloud VMware Engines hosts.

=====

.Step 5: Configure the network profile, compute profile, and service mesh
[%collapsible]
=====
The VMware HCX Interconnect service appliance provides replication and vMotion-based migration capabilities over the internet and private connections to the target site. The interconnect provides encryption, traffic engineering, and VM mobility. To create an Interconnect service appliance, complete the followings steps:

. Under Infrastructure, select *Interconnect > Multi-Site Service Mesh > Compute Profiles > Create Compute Profile*.
+
[NOTE]
The compute profiles define the deployment parameters including the appliances that are deployed and which portion of the VMware data center are accessible to HCX service.
+
image:gcpd-hcx-image11.png[Screenshot of the vSphere client Interconnect page.]

. After the compute profile is created, create the network profiles by selecting *Multi-Site Service Mesh > Network Profiles > Create Network Profile*.
+
The network profile defines a range of IP address and networks that are used by HCX for its virtual appliances.
+
[NOTE]
This step requires two or more IP addresses. These IP addresses are assigned from the management network to the Interconnect Appliances.
+
image:gcpd-hcx-image12.png[Screenshot of Network Profile.]

. At this time, the compute and network profiles have been successfully created.
. Create the Service Mesh by selecting the *Service Mesh* tab within the *Interconnect* option and select the on-premises and GCVE SDDC sites.
. The Service Mesh specifies a local and remote compute and network profile pair. 
+
[NOTE]
As part of this process, the HCX appliances are deployed and automatically configured on both the source and target sites in order to create a secure transport fabric.
+
image:gcpd-hcx-image13.png[Screenshot of Service Mesh tab on the vSphere client Interconnect page.]

. This is the final step of configuration. This should take close to 30 minutes to complete the deployment. After the service mesh is configured, the environment is ready with the IPsec tunnels successfully created to migrate the workload VMs.
+
image:gcpd-hcx-image14.png[Screenshot of the HCX Appliances on the vSphere client Interconnect page.]
=====

.Step 6: Migrate workloads
[%collapsible]
=====
Workloads can be migrated bidirectionally between on-premises and GCVE SDDCs using various VMware HCX migration technologies. VMs can be moved to and from VMware HCX-activated entities using multiple migration technologies such as HCX bulk migration, HCX vMotion, HCX Cold migration, HCX Replication Assisted vMotion (available with HCX Enterprise edition), and HCX OS Assisted Migration (available with the HCX Enterprise edition).

To learn more about various HCX migration mechanisms, see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.5/hcx-user-guide/GUID-8A31731C-AA28-4714-9C23-D9E924DBB666.html[VMware HCX Migration Types^].

The HCX-IX appliance uses the Mobility Agent service to perform vMotion, Cold, and Replication Assisted vMotion (RAV) migrations.
[NOTE]
The HCX-IX appliance adds the Mobility Agent service as a host object in the vCenter Server. The processor, memory, storage and networking resources displayed on this object do not represent actual consumption on the physical hypervisor hosting the IX appliance.

*HCX vMotion*

This section describes the HCX vMotion mechanism. This migration technology uses the VMware vMotion protocol to migrate a VM to GCVE.  The vMotion migration option is used for migrating the VM state of a single VM at a time.  There is no service interruption during this migration method.  

[NOTE]
Network Extension should be in place (for the port group in which the VM is attached) in order to migrate the VM without the need to make an IP address change.

. From the on-premises vSphere client,  go to Inventory, right- click on the VM to be migrated,  and select HCX Actions > Migrate to HCX Target Site.
+
image:gcpd-hcx-image15.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. In the Migrate Virtual Machine wizard,  select the Remote Site Connection (target GCVE). 
+
image:gcpd-hcx-image16.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Update the mandatory fields (Cluster, Storage, and Destination Network), Click Validate.
+
image:gcpd-hcx-image17.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. After the validation checks are complete, click Go to initiate the migration.
+
[NOTE]
The vMotion transfer captures the VM active memory, its execution state, its IP address, and its MAC address.  For more information about the requirements and limitations of HCX vMotion,  see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.5/hcx-user-guide/GUID-517866F6-AF06-4EFC-8FAE-DA067418D584.html[Understanding VMware HCX vMotion and Cold Migration^].

. You can monitor the progress and completion of the vMotion from the HCX > Migration dashboard.
+
image:gcpd-hcx-image18.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[NOTE]
The target CVS NFS datastore should have sufficient space to handle the migration.
