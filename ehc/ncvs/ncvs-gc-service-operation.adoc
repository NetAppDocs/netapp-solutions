The Cloud Volumes Service team manages the backend services in Google Cloud and uses multiple strategies to secure the platform and prevent unwanted access.

Each customer gets their own unique subnet that has access fenced off from other customers by default, and every tenant in Cloud Volumes Service gets their own namespace and VLAN for total data isolation. After a user is authenticated, the Service Delivery Engine (SDE) can only read configuration data specific to that tenant.

== Physical security

With proper preapproval, only onsite engineers and NetApp-badged Field Support Engineers (FSEs) have access to the cage and racks for physical work. Storage and network management is not permitted. Only these onsite resources are able to perform hardware maintenance tasks.

For onsite engineers, a ticket is raised for the statement of work (SOW) that includes the rack ID and device location (RU) and all other details are included in the ticket. For NetApp FSEs, a site visitation ticket must be raised with the COLO and the ticket includes the visitor’s details, date,  and time for auditing purposes. The SOW for the FSE is communicated internally to NetApp.

== Operations team

The operations team for Cloud Volumes Service consists of Production Engineering and a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for Cloud Volume Services and NetApp Field Support Engineers and Partners for hardware. All operations team members are accredited for work in Google Cloud and detailed records of work are maintained for every ticket raised. In addition, there is a stringent change control and approval process in place to ensure each decision is appropriately scrutinized.

The SRE team manages the control plane and how the data is routed from UI requests to backend hardware and software in Cloud Volumes Service. The SRE team also manages system resources, such as volume and inode maximums. SREs are not allowed to interact with or have access to customer data. SREs also provide coordination with Return Material Authorizations (RMAs), such as new disk or memory replacement requests for the backend hardware.

== Customer responsibilities

Customers of Cloud Volumes Service manage their organization’s Active Directory and user role management as well as the volume and data operations. Customers can have administrative roles and can delegate permissions to other end users within the same Google Cloud project using the two predefined roles that NetApp and Google Cloud provide (Administrator and Viewer).

The administrator can peer any VPC within the customer project to Cloud Volumes Service that the customer determines to be appropriate. It is the responsibility of the customer to manage access to their Google Cloud marketplace subscription and to manage the VPCs that have access to the data plane.

== Malicious SRE protection

One concern that could arise is how does Cloud Volumes Service protect against scenarios in which there is a malicious SRE or when SRE credentials have been compromised?

Access to the production environment is with a limited number of SRE individuals only. Administrative privileges are further restricted to a handful of experienced administrators. All actions performed by anyone in the Cloud Volumes Service production environment are logged and any anomalies to the baseline or suspicious activities are detected by our security information and event management (SIEM) threat intelligence platform. As a result, malicious actions can be tracked and mitigated before too much damage is done to the Cloud Volumes Service backend.

== Volume life cycle

Cloud Volumes Service manages only the objects within the service—not the data within the volumes. Only clients accessing the volumes can manage the data, the ACLs, file owners, and so on. The data in these volumes is encrypted at rest and access is limited to tenants of the Cloud Volumes Service instance.

The volume lifecycle for Cloud Volumes Service is create-update-delete. Volumes retain Snapshot copies of volumes until the volumes are deleted, and only validated Cloud Volumes Service administrators can delete volumes in Cloud Volumes Service. When a volume deletion is requested by an administrator, an additional step of entering the volume name is required to verify the deletion. After a volume is deleted, the volume is gone and cannot be recovered.

In cases where a Cloud Volumes Service contract is terminated, NetApp marks volumes for deletion after a specific time period. Before that time period expires, you can recover volumes at the customer’s request.

== Certifications

Cloud Volumes Services for Google Cloud is currently certified to ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27018:2019 standards. The service also recently received its SOC2 Type I attestation report.
