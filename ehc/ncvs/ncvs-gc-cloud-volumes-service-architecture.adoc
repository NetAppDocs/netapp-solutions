In a manner similar to other Google Cloud native services such as CloudSQL, Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE), and FileStore, Cloud Volumes Service uses https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-services-access?hl=en_US[Google PSA^] to deliver the service. In PSA, services are built inside a service producer project, which uses https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering?hl=en_US[VPC network peering^] to connect to the service consumer. The service producer is provided and operated by NetApp, and the service consumer is a VPC in a customer project, hosting the clients that want to access Cloud Volumes Service file shares.

The following figure, referenced from the https://cloud.google.com/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/architecture?hl=en_US[architecture section^] of the Cloud Volumes Service documentation, shows a high-level view.

The part above the dotted line shows the control plane of the service, which controls the volume lifecycle. The part below the dotted line shows the data plane. The left blue box depicts the user VPC (service consumer), the right blue box is the service producer provided by NetApp. Both are connected through VPC peering.

== Tenancy model

In Cloud Volumes Service, individual projects are considered unique tenants. This means that manipulation of volumes, Snapshot copies, and so on are performed on a per- project basis. In other words, all volumes are owned by the project that they were created in and only that project can manage and access the data inside of them by default. This is considered the control plane view of the service.

=== Shared VPCs

On the data plane view, Cloud Volumes Service can connect to a shared VPC. You can create volumes in the hosting project or in one of the service projects connected to the shared VPC. All projects (host or service) connected to that shared VPC are able to reach the volumes at the network layer (TCP/IP). Because all clients with network connectivity on the shared- VPC can potentially access the data through NAS protocols, access control on the individual volume (such as user/group access control lists (ACLs) and hostnames/IP addresses for NFS exports) must be used to control who can access the data.

You can connect Cloud Volumes Service to up to five VPCs per customer project. On the control plane, the project enables you to manage all created volumes, no matter which VPC they are connected to. On the data plane, VPCs are isolated from one another, and each volume can only be connected to one VPC.

Access to the individual volumes is controlled by protocol specific (NFS/SMB) access control mechanisms.

In other words, on the network layer, all project s connected to the shared VPC are able to see the volume, while,  on the management side, the control plane only allows the owner project to see the volume.

=== VPC Service Controls

VPC Service Controls establish an access control perimeter around Google Cloud services that are attached to the internet and are accessible worldwide. These services provide access control through user identities but cannot restrict which network location requests originate from. VPC Service Controls close that gap by introducing the capabilities to restrict access to defined networks.

The Cloud Volumes Service data plane is not connected to the external internet but to private VPCs with well-defined network boundaries (perimeters). Within that network, each volume uses protocol-specific access control. Any external network connectivity is explicitly created by Google Cloud project administrators. The control plane, however, does not provide the same protections as the data plane and can be accessed by anyone from anywhere with valid credentials ( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519[JWT tokens^]).

In short, the Cloud Volumes Service data plane provides the capability of network access control, without the requirement to support VPC Service Controls and does not explicitly use VPC Service Controls.

=== Packet sniffing/trace considerations

Packet captures can be useful for troubleshooting network issues or other problems (such as NAS permissions, LDAP connectivity, and so on), but can also be used maliciously to gain information about network IP addresses, MAC addresses, user and group names, and what level of security is being used on endpoints. Because of the way Google Cloud networking, VPCs, and firewall rules are configured, unwanted access to network packets should be difficult to obtain without user login credentials or link:<ncvs-gc-control-plane-architecture.html#jwt-tokens[JWT tokens] into the cloud instances. Packet captures are only possible on endpoints (such as virtual machines (VMs)) and only possible on endpoints internal to the VPC unless a shared VPC and/or external network tunnel/IP forwarding is in use to explicitly allow external traffic to endpoints. There is no way to sniff traffic outside of the clients.

When shared VPCs are used, in-flight encryption with NFS Kerberos and/or link:ncvs-gc-data-encryption-in-transit.html#smb-encryption[SMB encryption] can mask much of the information gleaned from traces. However, some traffic is still sent in plaintext, such as link:ncvs-gc-other-nas-infrastructure-service-dependencies.html#dns[DNS] and link:cvs-gc-other-nas-infrastructure-service-dependencies.html#ldap-queries[LDAP queries]. The following figure shows a packet capture from a plaintext LDAP query originating from Cloud Volumes Service and the potential identifying information that is exposed. LDAP queries in Cloud Volumes Service currently do not support encryption or LDAP over SSL. CVS-Performance support LDAP signing, if requested by Active Directory. CVS-SW does not support LDAP signing.

[NOTE]
unixUserPassword is queried by LDAP and is not sent in plaintext but instead in a salted hash.  By default, Windows LDAP does not populate the unixUserPassword fields. This field is only required if you need to leverage Windows LDAP for interactive logins through LDAP to clients. Cloud Volumes Service does not support interactive LDAP logins to the instances.

The following figure shows a packet capture from an NFS Kerberos conversation next to a capture of NFS over AUTH_SYS. Note how the information available in a trace differs between the two and how enabling in-flight encryption offers greater overall security for NAS traffic.

=== VM network interfaces

One trick attackers might attempt is to add a new network interface card (NIC) to a VM in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode[promiscuous mode^] (port mirroring) or enable promiscuous mode on an existing NIC in order to sniff all traffic. In Google Cloud, adding a new NIC requires a VM to be shut down entirely, which creates alerts, so attackers cannot do this unnoticed.

In addition, NICs cannot be set to promiscuous mode at all and will trigger alerts in Google Cloud.
