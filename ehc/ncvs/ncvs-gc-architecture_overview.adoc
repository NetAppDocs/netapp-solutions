Part of trusting a cloud solution is understanding the architecture and how it is secured. This section calls out different aspects of the Cloud Volumes Service architecture in Google to help alleviate potential concerns about how data is secured, as well as call out areas where additional configuration steps might be required to obtain the most secure deployment.

The general architecture of Cloud Volumes Service can be broken down into two main components: the control plane and the data plane.

== Control plane

The control plane in Cloud Volumes Service is the backend infrastructure managed by Cloud Volumes Service administrators and NetApp native automation software. This plane is completely transparent to end users and includes networking, storage hardware, software updates,  and so on to help deliver value to a cloud-resident solution such as Cloud Volumes Service.

== Data plane

The data plane in Cloud Volumes Service includes the actual data volumes and the overall Cloud Volumes Service configuration (such as access control, Kerberos authentication, and so on). The data plane is entirely under the control of the end users and the consumers of the Cloud Volumes Service platform.

There are distinct differences in how each plane is secured and managed. The following sections cover these differences, starting with a Cloud Volumes Service architecture overview.
