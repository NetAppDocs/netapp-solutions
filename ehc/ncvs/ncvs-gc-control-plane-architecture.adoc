All management actions to Cloud Volumes Service are done through API. Cloud Volumes Service management integrated into the GCP Cloud Console also uses the Cloud Volumes Service API.

== Identity and Access Management

Identity and Access Management (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview[IAM^]) is a standard service that enables you to control authentication (logins) and authorization (permissions) to Google Cloud project instances. Google IAM provides a full audit trail of permissions authorization and removal. Currently Cloud Volumes Service does not provide control plane auditing.

=== Authorization/permission overview

IAM offers built-in, granular permissions for Cloud Volumes Service. You can find a https://cloud.google.com/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/security-considerations?hl=en_US[complete list of granular permissions here^].

IAM also offers two predefined roles called `netappcloudvolumes.admin` and `netappcloudvolumes.viewer`. These roles can be assigned to specific users or service accounts.

Assign appropriate roles and permission to allow IAM users to manage Cloud Volumes Service.

Examples for using granular permissions include the following:

* Build a custom role with only get/list/create/update permissions so that users cannot delete volumes.
* Use a custom role with only `snapshot.*` permissions to create a service account that is used to build application- consistent Snapshot integration.
* Build a custom role to delegate `volumereplication.*` to specific users.

=== Service accounts

To make Cloud Volumes Service API calls through scripts or https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-gcp/latest/docs[Terraform^], you must create a service account with the `roles/netappcloudvolumes.admin` role. You can use this service account to generate the JWT tokens required to authenticate Cloud Volumes Service API requests in two different ways:

* Generate a JSON key and use Google APIs to derive a JWT token from it. This is the simplest approach, but it involves manual secrets (the JSON key) management.
* Use https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts[Service account impersonation^] with `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`. The code (script, Terraform, and so on.) runs with https://google.aip.dev/auth/4110[Application Default Credentials^] and impersonates the service account to gain its permissions. This approach reflects Google security best practices.

See https://cloud.google.com/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/api?hl=en_US[Creating your service account and private key^] in the Google cloud documentation for more information.

== Cloud Volumes Service API

Cloud Volumes Service API uses a REST-based API by using HTTPS (TLSv1.2) as the underlying network transport. You can find the latest API definition https://cloudvolumesgcp-api.netapp.com/swagger.json[here^] and information about how to use the API at https://cloud.google.com/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/api?hl=en_US[Cloud Volumes APIs in the Google cloud documentation^].

The API endpoint is operated and secured by NetApp using standard HTTPS (TLSv1.2) functionality.

=== JWT tokens

Authentication to the API is performed with JWT bearer tokens (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519[RFC-7519^]). Valid JWT tokens must be obtained by using Google Cloud IAM authentication. This must be done by fetching a token from IAM by providing a service account JSON key.

== Audit logging

Currently, no user-accessible control plane audit logs are available.
