summary: Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud leverages the Google Cloud private services access framework. In this framework, users can connect to the Cloud Volumes Service. This framework uses Service Networking and VPC peering constructs like other Google Cloud services, ensuring complete isolation between tenants.

Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud leverages the Google Cloud https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-services-access[private services access^] framework. In this framework, users can connect to the Cloud Volumes Service. This framework uses Service Networking and VPC peering constructs like other Google Cloud services, ensuring complete isolation between tenants.

For an architecture overview of Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud, see https://cloud.google.com/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/architecture[Architecture for Cloud Volumes Service^].

User VPCs (standalone or shared) are peered to VPCs within Cloud Volumes Service managed tenant projects, which hosts the volumes.

The preceding figure shows a project (the CVS consumer project in the middle) with three VPC networks connected to Cloud Volumes Service and multiple Compute Engine VMs (GCE1-7) sharing volumes:

* VPC1 allows GCE1 to access volumes A and B.
* VPC2 allows GCE2 and GCE4 to access volume C.
* The third VPC network is a shared VPC, shared with two service projects. It allows GCE3, GCE4, GCE5, and GCE6 to access volumes D and E. Shared VPC networks are only supported for volumes of the CVS-Performance service type.

[NOTE]
GCE7 cannot access any volume.

Data can be encrypted both in-transit (using Kerberos and/or SMB encryption) and at-rest in Cloud Volumes Service.
