Customers can expand storage capacity on Google Cloud VMware Engine using NFS supplemental datastore with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes.

== Overview

Customers that requires additional storage capacity on their Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) environment can utilize Netapp Cloud Volume Service to mount as supplemental NFS datastore.
Storing data on Google Cloud NetApp Volumes allows customers to replicate between regions to protect from diaster.

====

.Mark that NetApp Volumes volume as non-deletable

====

.Ensure Private Connection on GCVE exists for NetApp Volumes Tenant VPC.

====
To mount NFS Datastore, there should be a private connection exists between GCVE and NetApp Volumes project.

[NOTE]
As vSphere hosts are managed by Google, you don't have access to install NFS vSphere API for Array Integration (VAAI) vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB).
If you need support for Virtual Volumes (vVol), please let us know.
If you like to use Jumbo Frames, please refer link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/mtu[Maximum supported MTU sizes on GCP]
