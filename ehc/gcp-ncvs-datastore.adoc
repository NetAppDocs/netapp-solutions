== Deployment steps to mount NFS datastore from NetApp CVS on GCVE

.Provision CVS-Performance Volume
[%collapsible]
====
The NetApp Cloud Volume Service volume can be either provisioned by

====

.Mark that CVS volume as non-deletable
[%collapsible]
====
To avoid accidental deletion of volume while VM is running, ensure the volume is marked as non-deletable as shown in screenshot below.

====

.Ensure Private Connection on GCVE exists for NetApp CVS Tenant VPC.
[%collapsible]
====
To mount NFS Datastore, there should be a private connection exists between GCVE and NetApp CVS project.

[NOTE]
As vSphere hosts are managed by Google, you don't have access to install NFS vSphere API for Array Integration (VAAI) vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB).
If you need support for Virtual Volumes (vVol), please let us know.
If you like to use Jumbo Frames, please refer link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/mtu[Maximum supported MTU sizes on GCP]
