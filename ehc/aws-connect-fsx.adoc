To connect VMware Cloud to FSx ONTAP, complete the following steps:

. With VMware Cloud deployment completed and connected to AWS VPC, you must deploy Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP into a new VPC rather than the original connected VPC (see the screenshot below). FSx (NFS and SMB floating IPs) is not accessible if it is deployed in the connected VPC. Keep in mind that ISCSI endpoints like Cloud Volumes ONTAP work just fine from the connected VPC.

. Deploy an additional VPC in the same region, and then deploy Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP into the new VPC.
+
Configuration of an SDDC group in the VMware Cloud console enables the networking configuration options required to connect to the new VPC where FSx is deployed. In step 3, verify that “Configuring VMware Transit Connect for your group will incur charges per attachment and data transfers” is checked, and then choose Create Group. The process can take a few minutes to complete.

. Attach the newly created VPC to the just created SDDC group. Select the External VPC tab and follow the link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/com.vmware.vmc-aws-operations/GUID-A3D03968-350E-4A34-A53E-C0097F5F26A9.html[instructions for attaching an External VPC] to the group. This process can take 10 to 15 minutes to complete.

. As part of the external VPC process, you are prompted through the AWS console to a new shared resource via the Resource Access Manager. The shared resource is the link:https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway[AWS Transit Gateway] managed by VMware Transit Connect.

. Create the Transit Gateway Attachment.

. Back on the VMC Console, Accept the VPC attachment. This process can take approximately 10 minutes to complete.

. While in the External VPC tab, click the edit icon in the Routes column and add in the following required routes:
+
* A route for the floating IP range for Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/supported-fsx-clients.html[floating IPs].
* A route for the floating IP range for Cloud Volumes ONTAP (if applicable).
* A route for the newly created external VPC address space.

. Finally, allow bidirectional traffic link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/com.vmware.vmc-aws-operations/GUID-DE330202-D63D-408A-AECF-7CDC6ADF7EAC.html[firewall rules] for access to FSx/CVO. Follow these link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/com.vmware.vmc-aws-operations/GUID-DE330202-D63D-408A-AECF-7CDC6ADF7EAC.html[detailed steps] for compute gateway firewall rules for SDDC workload connectivity.

. After the firewall groups are configured for both the Management and Compute gateway, the vCenter can be accessed as follows:

The next step is to verify that Amazon FSx ONTAP or Cloud Volumes ONTAP is configured depending on your requirements and that the volumes are provisioned to offload storage components from vSAN to optimize the deployment.
