[.lead]
To configure a GCVE environment on GCP, login to the GCP console and access the VMware Engine portal. 

Click on the “New Private Cloud” button and enter the desired configuration for the GCVE Private Cloud. On “Location”, make sure to deploy the private cloud in the same Region/Zone where CVS/CVO is deployed, to ensure the best performance and lowest latency.

Pre-requisites:

* Setup VMware Engine Service Admin IAM role

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_replicating_data.html[Enable VMWare Engine API access and node quota]

* Make sure that the CIDR range doesn't overlap with any of your on-premises or cloud subnets. The CIDR range must be /27 or higher.
