Azure VMware Solution does not allow you to manage a private cloud with on-premises VMware vCenter. Instead, jump host is required to connect to the Azure VMware Solution vCenter instance. Create a jump host in the designated resource group and sign in to the Azure VMware Solution vCenter. This jump host should be a Windows VM on the same virtual network that was created for connectivity and should provide access to both vCenter and the NSX Manager.

After the virtual machine is provisioned, use the Connect option to access RDP.

Sign in to vCenter from this newly created jump host virtual machine by using the cloud admin user . To access the credentials, go to the Azure portal and navigate to Identity (under the Manage option within the private cloud). The URLs and user credentials for the private cloud vCenter and NSX-T Manager can be copied from here.

In the Windows virtual machine, open a browser and navigate to the vCenter web client URL (https://10.21.0.2/) and use the admin user name as *cloudadmin@vsphere.local* and paste the copied password. Similarly, NSX-T manager can also be accessed using the web client URL (https://10.21.0.3/) and use the admin user name and paste the copied password to create new segments or modify the existing tier gateways.

NOTE: The web client URLs are different for each SDDC provisioned.

The Azure VMware Solution SDDC is now deployed and configured. Leverage ExpressRoute Global Reach to connect the on-premises environment to Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
