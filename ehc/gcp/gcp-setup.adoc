As with on-premises, planning Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) is critical for a successful production-ready environment for creating VMs and migration.

This section describes how to set up and manage GCVE and use it in combination with the available options for connecting NetApp storage.

The setup process can be broken down into the following steps:

.Deploy and configure GCVE
[%collapsible]
====

To configure a GCVE environment on GCP, login to the GCP console and access the VMware Engine portal.

Click on the “New Private Cloud” button and enter the desired configuration for the GCVE Private Cloud. On “Location”, make sure to deploy the private cloud in the same Region/Zone where CVS/CVO is deployed, to ensure the best performance and lowest latency.

Pre-requisites:

* Setup VMware Engine Service Admin IAM role

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_replicating_data.html[Enable VMWare Engine API access and node quota]

* Make sure that the CIDR range doesn't overlap with any of your on-premises or cloud subnets. The CIDR range must be /27 or higher.

Note: Private cloud creation can take between 30 minutes to 2 hours.

.Enable Private Access to GCVE

====

Once the Private Cloud is provisioned, configure private access to the Private Cloud for high-throughput and low-latency data-path connection.

This will ensure that the VPC network where Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances are running is able to communicate with the GCVE Private Cloud. To do so, follow the link:https://cloud.google.com/architecture/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/quickstart[GCP documentation]. For the Cloud Volume Service, establish a connection between VMware Engine and Cloud Volumes Service by performing a one-time peering between the tenant host projects. For detailed steps, follow this link:https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/vmware-ecosystem/howto-cloud-volumes-service[link].

Sign in to vcenter using the CloudOwner@gve.local user. To access the credentials, go to the VMware Engine portal, Go to Resources, and select the appropriate private cloud. In the Basic info section, click the View link for either vCenter login info (vCenter Server, HCX Manager) or NSX-T login info (NSX Manager).

In a Windows virtual machine, open a browser and navigate to the vCenter web client URL (https://10.0.16.6/) and use the admin user name as CloudOwner@gve.local and paste the copied password. Similarly, NSX-T manager can also be accessed using the web client URL (https://10.0.16.11/) and use the admin user name and paste the copied password to create new segments or modify the existing tier gateways.

For connecting from an on-premises network to VMware Engine private cloud, leverage cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect for appropriate connectivity and make sure the required ports are open. For detailed steps, follow this link:https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-iscsi[link].
