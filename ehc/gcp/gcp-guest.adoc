GCP supports guest connected NetApp storage with Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) or Cloud Volumes Service (CVS).

[[gcp-cvo]]

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO)

Cloud volumes ONTAP, or CVO, is the industry-leading cloud data management solution built on NetApp’s ONTAP storage software, available natively on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

It is a software-defined version of ONTAP that consumes cloud-native storage, allowing you to have the same storage software in the cloud and on-premises, reducing the need to retrain you IT staff in all-new methods to manage your data.

CVO gives customers the ability to seamlessly move data from the edge, to the data center, to the cloud and back, bringing your hybrid cloud together — all managed with a single-pane management console, NetApp Cloud Manager.

By design, CVO delivers extreme performance and advanced data management capabilities to satisfy even your most demanding applications in the cloud

=====

Cloud Volumes ONTAP shares and LUNs can be mounted from VMs that are created in the GCVE private cloud environment. The volumes can also be mounted on the Linux client and on Windows client and LUNS can be accessed on Linux or Windows clients as block devices when mounted over iSCSI because Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports iSCSI, SMB, and NFS protocols. Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes can be set up in a few simple steps.

To replicate volumes from an on-premises environment to the cloud for disaster recovery or migration purposes, establish network connectivity to Google Cloud, either using a site-to-site VPN or Cloud Interconnect. Replicating data from on-premises to Cloud Volumes ONTAP is outside the scope of this document. To replicate data between on-premises and Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, see link:mailto:CloudOwner@gve.local#setting-up-data-replication-between-systems[Setting up data replication between systems].

NOTE: Use link:https://cloud.netapp.com/cvo-sizer[Cloud Volumes ONTAP sizer] to accurately size the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances. Also monitor on-premises performance to use as inputs in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP sizer.

To accomplish the same for the host residing on Google Cloud VMware Engine:

.. RDP to the VM hosted on Google Cloud VMware Engine.
.. Open the iSCSI Initiator Properties dialog box: Server Manager > Dashboard > Tools > iSCSI Initiator.
.. From the Discovery tab, click Discover Portal or Add Portal and then enter the IP address of the iSCSI target port.
.. From the Targets tab, select the target discovered and then click Log on or Connect.
.. Select Enable multipath, and then select Automatically Restore This Connection When the Computer Starts or Add This Connection to the List of Favorite Targets. Click Advanced.
+
NOTE: The Windows host must have an iSCSI connection to each node in the cluster. The native DSM selects the best paths to use.
+
image:gcve-cvo-guest-18.png[]
+
LUNs on storage virtual machine (SVM) appear as disks to the Windows host. Any new disks that are added are not automatically discovered by the host. Trigger a manual rescan to discover the disks by completing the following steps:

. Open the Windows Computer Management utility: Start > Administrative Tools > Computer Management.
. Expand the Storage node in the navigation tree.
. Click Disk Management.
. Click Action > Rescan Disks.
+
image:gcve-cvo-guest-19.png[]
+
When a new LUN is first accessed by the Windows host, it has no partition or file system. Initialize the LUN; and optionally, format the LUN with a file system by completing the following steps:

. Start Windows Disk Management.
. Right-click the LUN, and then select the required disk or partition type.
. Follow the instructions in the wizard. In this example, drive F: is mounted.

image:gcve-cvo-guest-20.png[]

On the Linux clients, ensure the iSCSI daemon is running. Once the LUNs are provisioned, refer to the detailed guidance on iSCSI configuration with Ubuntu as an example here. To verify, run lsblk cmd from the shell.
