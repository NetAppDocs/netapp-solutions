The following process provides instructions on how to recover Oracle application data in VMware Cloud Services in AWS in the event of a disaster that renders the on-premises site inoperable.

Complete the following prerequisites to continue with the recovery steps:

. The Oracle Linux server VM has been restored to the VMware Cloud SDDC using Veeam Full Restore.
. A secondary SnapCenter server has been established and the SnapCenter database and configuration files have been restored using the steps outlined in this section link:aws-guest-dr-snapcenter-db-backup.html#snapcenter-backup-and-restore-process-summary["SnapCenter backup and restore process summary."]

A summary of the Oracle application data recovery process is as follows:

. Configure the VM in preparation for the restore process.
. Set up FSx for iSCSI access.
. Set up the Linux VM for NFS access.
. Attach the SQL Server database and bring it online.
. Confirm communication between SnapCenter and the SnapCenter SQL Server Plug-in.

A summary of the Oracle Server failover process is as follows:

. Restore the Oracle VM to the VMware Cloud using Veeam.
. Clean up the VM in preparation for the restore process:
.. Change the IP addresses as required.
.. Add the system to DNS with an FQDN identical to the original.
. Set up FSx for NFS access.
. Mount the NFS volumes on the Oracle Linux Server.

== Configure FSx for Oracle restore â€“ Break the SnapMirror relationship

To make the secondary storage volumes hosted on the FSxN instance accessible to the Oracle servers, you must first break the existing SnapMirror relationship.

. After logging into the FSx CLI, run the following command to view the volumes filtered by the correct name.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> volume show -volume VolumeName*
....
+

. Run the following command to break the existing SnapMirror relationships.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror break -destination-path DestSVM:DestVolName
....
+

. Update the junction-path in the Amazon FSx web client:

. Add the junction path name and click Update. Specify this junction path when mounting the NFS volume from the Oracle server.

== Mount NFS volumes on Oracle Server

In Cloud Manager, you can obtain the mount command with the correct NFS LIF IP address for mounting the NFS volumes that contain the Oracle database files and logs.

. In Cloud Manager, access the list of volumes for your FSx cluster.

. From the action menu, select Mount Command to view and copy the mount command to be used on our Oracle Linux server.

. Mount the NFS file system to the Oracle Linux Server. The directories for mounting the NFS share already exist on the Oracle Linux host.
. From the Oracle Linux server,  use the mount command to mount the NFS volumes.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> mount -t oracle_server_ip:/junction-path
....
+
Repeat this step for each volume associated with the Oracle databases.
+
[NOTE]
To make the NFS mount persistent upon rebooting, edit the `/etc/fstab` file to include the mount commands.

. Reboot the Oracle server. The Oracle databases should start up normally and be available for use.
