AWS supports guest connected NetApp storage with the native FSx service (FSx ONTAP) or with Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO).

[[fsx-ontap]]

== FSx ONTAP

Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a fully managed service that provides highly reliable, scalable, high-performing, and feature-rich file storage built on NetApp's popular ONTAP file system. FSx for ONTAP combines the familiar features, performance, capabilities, and API operations of NetApp file systems with the agility, scalability, and simplicity of a fully managed AWS service.

FSx for ONTAP provides feature-rich, fast, and flexible shared file storage that’s broadly accessible from Linux, Windows, and macOS compute instances running in AWS or on premises. FSx for ONTAP offers high-performance solid state drive (SSD) storage with submillisecond latencies. With FSx for ONTAP, you can achieve SSD levels of performance for your workload while paying for SSD storage for only a small fraction of your data.

Managing your data with FSx for ONTAP is easier because you can snapshot, clone, and replicate your files with the click of a button. In addition, FSx for ONTAP automatically tiers your data to lower-cost, elastic storage, lessening the need for you to provision or manage capacity.

FSx for ONTAP also provides highly available and durable storage with fully managed backups and support for cross-Region disaster recovery. To make it easier to protect and secure your data, FSx for ONTAP supports popular data security and antivirus applications.

=== FSx ONTAP as guest connected storage

.Configure Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with VMware Cloud on AWS
[%collapsible]
=====

Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP files shares and LUNs can be mounted from VMs that are created within the VMware SDDC environment at  VMware Cloud at AWS. The volumes can also be mounted on the Linux client and mapped on the Windows client using the NFS or SMB protocol, and LUNS can be accessed on Linux or Windows clients as block devices when mounted over iSCSI. Amazon FSx for the NetApp ONTAP file system can be set up quickly with the following steps.

NOTE: Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP and VMware Cloud on AWS must be in the same availability zone to achieve better performance and avoid data transfer charges between availability zones.

NOTE: In the Networking section, for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), choose the appropriate VPC and preferred subnets along with the route table. In this case, vmcfsx2.vpc is selected from the dropdown.

. In the Security & Encryption section, for the Encryption Key, choose the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key that protects the file system's data at rest. For the File System Administrative Password, enter a secure password for the fsxadmin user.

image:aws-fsx-guest-5.png[]

. In virtual machine and specify the password to use with vsadmin for administering ONTAP using REST APIs or the CLI. If no password is specified, a fsxadmin user can be used for administering the SVM. In the Active Directory section, make sure to join Active Directory to the SVM for provisioning SMB shares. In the Default Storage Virtual Machine Configuration section, provide a name for the storage in this validation, SMB shares are provisioned using a self-managed Active Directory domain.

image:aws-fsx-guest-6.png[]

. In the Default Volume Configuration section, specify the volume name and size. This is an NFS volume. For Storage Efficiency, choose Enabled to turn on the ONTAP storage efficiency features (compression, deduplication, and compaction) or Disabled to turn them off.

image:aws-fsx-guest-7.png[]

. Review the file system configuration shown on the Create File System page.

. Click Create File System.

iSCSI traffic for FSx traverses the VMware Transit Connect/AWS Transit Gateway via the routes provided in the previous section. To configure a LUN in Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, follow the documentation found link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/supported-fsx-clients.html[here].

On Linux clients, make sure that the iSCSI daemon is running. After the LUNs are provisioned, refer to the detailed guidance on iSCSI configuration with Ubuntu (as an example) link:https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-iscsi[here].

In this paper, connecting the iSCSI LUN to a Windows host is depicted:

. Connect the newly provisioned LUN to a Windows VM:

To connect the new LUN tor a Windows host residing on VMware cloud on AWS SDDC, complete the following steps:

.. RDP to the Windows VM hosted on the VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC.
.. Navigate to Server Manager > Dashboard > Tools > iSCSI Initiator to open the iSCSI Initiator Properties dialog box.
.. From the Discovery tab, click Discover Portal or Add Portal and then enter the IP address of the iSCSI target port.
.. From the Targets tab, select the target discovered and then click Log On or Connect.
.. Select Enable Multipath, and then select “Automatically Restore This Connection When the Computer Starts” or “Add This Connection to the List of Favorite Targets”. Click Advanced.

NOTE: The Windows host must have an iSCSI connection to each node in the cluster. The native DSM selects the best paths to use.

image:aws-fsx-guest-30.png[]

LUNs on the storage virtual machine (SVM) appear as disks to the Windows host. Any new disks that are added are not automatically discovered by the host. Trigger a manual rescan to discover the disks by completing the following steps:

. Open the Windows Computer Management utility: Start > Administrative Tools > Computer Management.
. Expand the Storage node in the navigation tree.
. Click Disk Management.
. Click Action > Rescan Disks.

image:aws-fsx-guest-31.png[]

When a new LUN is first accessed by the Windows host, it has no partition or file system. Initialize the LUN and, optionally, format the LUN with a file system by completing the following steps:

. Start Windows Disk Management.
. Right-click the LUN, and then select the required disk or partition type.
. Follow the instructions in the wizard. In this example, drive F: is mounted.

[[aws-cvo]]

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO)

Cloud volumes ONTAP, or CVO, is the industry-leading cloud data management solution built on NetApp’s ONTAP storage software, available natively on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

It is a software-defined version of ONTAP that consumes cloud-native storage, allowing you to have the same storage software in the cloud and on-premises, reducing the need to retrain you IT staff in all-new methods to manage your data.

CVO gives customers the ability to seamlessly move data from the edge, to the data center, to the cloud and back, bringing your hybrid cloud together — all managed with a single-pane management console, NetApp Cloud Manager.

By design, CVO delivers extreme performance and advanced data management capabilities to satisfy even your most demanding applications in the cloud

Cloud Volumes ONTAP shares and LUNs can be mounted from VMs that are created in the VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC environment. The volumes can also be mounted on native AWS VM Linux Windows clients, and LUNS can be accessed on Linux or Windows clients as block devices when mounted over iSCSI because Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports iSCSI, SMB, and NFS protocols. Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes can be set up in a few simple steps.

To replicate volumes from an on-premises environment to the cloud for disaster recovery or migration purposes, establish network connectivity to AWS, either using a site-to-site VPN or DirectConnect. Replicating data from on-premises to Cloud Volumes ONTAP is outside the scope of this document. To replicate data between on-premises and Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_replicating_data.html#setting-up-data-replication-between-systems[Setting up data replication between systems].

NOTE: Use the link:https://cloud.netapp.com/cvo-sizer[Cloud Volumes ONTAP sizer] to accurately size the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances. Also, monitor on-premises performance to use as inputs in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP sizer.
