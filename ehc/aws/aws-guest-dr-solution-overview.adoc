A proven disaster recovery (DR) environment and plan is critical for organizations to ensure that business-critical applications can be rapidly restored in the event of a major outage. This solution focuses on demonstrating DR use cases with a focus on VMware and NetApp technologies, both on-premises and with VMware Cloud on AWS.

NetApp has a long history of integration with VMware as evidenced by the tens of thousands of customers that have chosen NetApp as their storage partner for their virtualized environment. This integration continues with guest-connected options in the cloud and recent integrations with NFS datastores as well. This solution focuses on the use case commonly referred to as guest-connected storage.

In guest-connected storage, the guest VMDK is deployed on a VMware-provisioned datastore, and application data is housed on iSCSI or NFS and mapped directly to the VM. Oracle and MS SQL applications are used to demonstrate a DR scenario, as shown in the following figure.
