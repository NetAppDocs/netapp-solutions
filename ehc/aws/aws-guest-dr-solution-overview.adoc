== Overview

A proven disaster recovery (DR) environment and plan is critical for organizations to ensure that business-critical applications can be rapidly restored in the event of a major outage. This solution focuses on demonstrating DR use cases with a focus on VMware and NetApp technologies, both on-premises and with VMware Cloud on AWS.

NetApp has a long history of integration with VMware as evidenced by the tens of thousands of customers that have chosen NetApp as their storage partner for their virtualized environment. This integration continues with guest-connected options in the cloud and recent integrations with NFS datastores as well. This solution focuses on the use case commonly referred to as guest-connected storage.

In guest-connected storage, the guest VMDK is deployed on a VMware-provisioned datastore, and application data is housed on iSCSI or NFS and mapped directly to the VM. Oracle and MS SQL applications are used to demonstrate a DR scenario, as shown in the following figure.

== Performing DR with SnapCenter

In this solution, SnapCenter provides application-consistent snapshots for SQL Server and Oracle application data. This configuration, together with SnapMirror technology, provides high-speed data replication between our on-premises AFF and FSx ONTAP cluster. Additionally, Veeam Backup & Replication provides backup and restore capabilities for our virtual machines.

In this section, we cover the configuration of SnapCenter, SnapMirror, and Veeam for both backup and restore.

The following sections cover configuration and the steps needed to complete a failover at the secondary site:


[[config-snapmirror]]
=== Configure SnapMirror relationships and retention schedules

SnapCenter can update SnapMirror relationships within the primary storage system (primary > mirror) and to secondary storage systems (primary > vault) for the purpose of long-term archiving and retention. To do so, you must establish and initialize a data replication relationship between a destination volume and a source volume using SnapMirror.

The source and destination ONTAP systems must be in networks that are peered using Amazon VPC peering, a transit gateway, AWS Direct Connect, or an AWS VPN.

The following steps are required for setting up SnapMirror relationships between an on-premises ONTAP system and FSx ONTAP:

NOTE: Refer to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/ONTAPGuide.pdf[FSx for ONTAP – ONTAP User Guide^] for more information on creating SnapMirror relationships with FSx.

.Record the source and destination Intercluster logical interfaces
[%collapsible]
==== 
For the source ONTAP system residing on-premises, you can retrieve the inter-cluster LIF information from System Manager or from the CLI.

. In ONTAP System Manager, navigate to the Network Overview page and retrieve the IP addresses of Type: Intercluster that are configured to communicate with the AWS VPC where FSx is installed.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image10.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. To retrieve the Intercluster IP addresses for FSx, log into the CLI and run the following command:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> network interface show -role intercluster
....
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image11.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
====

.Establish cluster peering between ONTAP and FSx
[%collapsible]
==== 
To establish cluster peering between ONTAP clusters, a unique passphrase entered at the initiating ONTAP cluster must be confirmed in the other peer cluster.

. Set up peering on the destination FSx cluster using the `cluster peer create` command. When prompted, enter a unique passphrase that is used later on the source cluster to finalize the creation process.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> cluster peer create -address-family ipv4 -peer-addrs source_intercluster_1, source_intercluster_2
Enter the passphrase:
Confirm the passphrase:
....

. At the source cluster,  you can establish the cluster peer relationship using either ONTAP System Manager or the CLI.  From ONTAP System Manager,  navigate to Protection > Overview and select Peer Cluster.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image12.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. In the Peer Cluster dialog box, fill out the required information:
.. Enter the passphrase that was used to establish the peer cluster relationship on the destination FSx cluster.
.. Select `Yes` to establish an encrypted relationship.
.. Enter the intercluster LIF IP address(es) of the destination FSx cluster.
.. Click Initiate Cluster Peering to finalize the process.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image13.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Verify the status of the cluster peer relationship from the FSx cluster with the following command:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> cluster peer show
....
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image14.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

====

.Establish SVM peering relationship
[%collapsible]
==== 
The next step is to set up an SVM relationship between the destination and source storage virtual machines that contain the volumes that will be in SnapMirror relationships.

. From the source FSx cluster, use the following command from the CLI to create the SVM peer relationship:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> vserver peer create -vserver DestSVM -peer-vserver Backup -peer-cluster OnPremSourceSVM -applications snapmirror
....

. From the source ONTAP cluster, accept the peering relationship with either ONTAP System Manager or the CLI.
. From ONTAP System Manager, go to Protection > Overview and select Peer Storage VMs under Storage VM Peers.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image15.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. In the Peer Storage VM’s dialog box, fill out the required fields:
+
** The source storage VM
** The destination cluster
** The destination storage VM
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image16.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Click Peer Storage VMs to complete the SVM peering process.
====

.Create a snapshot retention policy
[%collapsible]
==== 
SnapCenter manages retention schedules for backups that exist as snapshot copies on the primary storage system. This is established when creating a policy in SnapCenter. SnapCenter does not manage retention policies for backups that are retained on secondary storage systems. These policies are managed separately through a SnapMirror policy created on the secondary FSx cluster and associated with the destination volumes that are in a SnapMirror relationship with the source volume.

When creating a SnapCenter policy, you have the option to specify a secondary policy label that is added to the SnapMirror label of each snapshot generated when a SnapCenter backup is taken.

[NOTE]
On the secondary storage, these labels are matched to policy rules associated with the destination volume for the purpose of enforcing retention of snapshots.

The following example shows a SnapMirror label that is present on all snapshots generated as part of a policy used for daily backups of our SQL Server database and log volumes.

image:dr-vmc-aws-image17.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

For more information on creating SnapCenter policies for a SQL Server database, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-scsql/task_create_backup_policies_for_sql_server_databases.html[SnapCenter documentation^].

You must first create a SnapMirror policy with rules that dictate the number of snapshot copies to retain.

. Create the SnapMirror Policy on the FSx cluster.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror policy create -vserver DestSVM -policy PolicyName -type mirror-vault -restart always
....

. Add rules to the policy with SnapMirror labels that match the secondary policy labels specified in the SnapCenter policies.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver DestSVM -policy PolicyName -snapmirror-label SnapMirrorLabelName -keep #ofSnapshotsToRetain
....
+
The following script provides an example of a rule that could be added to a policy:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver sql_svm_dest -policy Async_SnapCenter_SQL -snapmirror-label sql-ondemand -keep 15
....
+
[NOTE]
Create additional rules for each SnapMirror label and the number of snapshots to be retained (retention period).

====

.Create destination volumes
[%collapsible]
==== 
To create a destination volume on FSx that will be the recipient of snapshot copies from our source volumes, run the following command on FSx ONTAP:

....
FSx-Dest::> volume create -vserver DestSVM -volume DestVolName -aggregate DestAggrName -size VolSize -type DP
....
====

.Create the SnapMirror relationships between source and destination volumes
[%collapsible]
==== 
To create a SnapMirror relationship between a source and destination volume, run the following command on FSx ONTAP:

....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror create -source-path OnPremSourceSVM:OnPremSourceVol -destination-path DestSVM:DestVol -type XDP -policy PolicyName
....
====

.Initialize the SnapMirror relationships
[%collapsible]
==== 
Initialize the SnapMirror relationship. This process initiates a new snapshot generated from the source volume and copies it to the destination volume.

To create a volume, run the following command on FSx ONTAP:

....
FSx-Dest::> volume create -vserver DestSVM -volume DestVolName -aggregate DestAggrName -size VolSize -type DP
....
====

=== Deploy and configure Windows SnapCenter server on-premises.

=== Failover

.Disaster occurs at primary site
[%collapsible]
====
For a disaster that occurs at the primary on-premises datacenter, our scenario includes failover to a secondary site residing on Amazon Web Services infrastructure using VMware Cloud on AWS. We assume that the virtual machines and our on-premises ONTAP cluster are no longer accessible. In addition, both the SnapCenter and Veeam virtual machines are no longer accessible and must be rebuilt at our secondary site.

This section address failover of our infrastructure to the cloud, and we cover the following topics:

* SnapCenter database restore. After a new SnapCenter server has been established, restore the MySQL database and configuration files and toggle the database into disaster recovery mode in order to allow the secondary FSx storage to become the primary storage device.
* Restore the application virtual machines using Veeam Backup & Replication. Connect the S3 storage that contains the VM backups, import the backups, and restore them to VMware Cloud on AWS.
* Restore the SQL Server application data using SnapCenter.
* Restore the Oracle application data using SnapCenter.
====

.SnapCenter database restore process
[%collapsible]
====
SnapCenter supports disaster recovery scenarios by allowing the backup and restore of its MySQL database and configuration files. This allows an administrator to maintain regular backups of the SnapCenter database at the on-premises datacenter and later restore that database to a secondary SnapCenter database.

To access the SnapCenter backup files on the remote SnapCenter server, complete the following steps:

. Break the SnapMirror relationship from the FSx cluster,  which makes the volume read/write.
. Create a CIFS server (if necessary) and create a CIFS share pointing to the junction path of the cloned volume.
. Use xcopy to copy the backup files to a local directory on the secondary SnapCenter system.
. Install SnapCenter v4.6.
. Ensure that SnapCenter server has the same FQDN as the original server. This is required for the db restore to be successful.

To start the restore process, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the Swagger API web page for the secondary SnapCenter server and follow the previous instructions to obtain an authorization token.
. Navigate to the Disaster Recovery section of the Swagger page, select `/4.6/disasterrecovery/server/restore`, and click Try it Out.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image48.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Paste in your authorization token and, in the SmDRResterRequest section, paste in the name of the backup and the local directory on the secondary SnapCenter server.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image49.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Select the Execute button to start the restore process.
. From SnapCenter, navigate to the Monitor section to view the progress of the restore job.

.VM: Post restore configuration for SQL Server VM
[%collapsible]
====
After the restore of the VM is complete, you must configure networking and other items in preparation for rediscovering the host VM within SnapCenter.

. Assign new IP addresses for Management and iSCSI or NFS.
. Join the host to the Windows domain.
. Add the hostnames to DNS or to the hosts file on the SnapCenter server.

[NOTE]
If the SnapCenter plug-in was deployed using domain credentials different than the current domain, you must change the Log On account for the Plug-in for Windows Service on the SQL Server VM. After changing the Log On account, restart the SnapCenter SMCore, Plug-in for Windows, and Plug-in for SQL Server services.

[NOTE]
To automatically rediscover the restored VMs in SnapCenter, the FQDN must be identical to the VM that was originally added to the SnapCenter on premises.

====

.Configure FSx storage for SQL Server restore
[%collapsible]
====
To accomplish the disaster recovery restore process for a SQL Server VM, you must break the existing SnapMirror relationship from the FSx cluster and grant access to the volume. To do so, complete the following steps.

. To break the existing SnapMirror relationship for the SQL Server database and log volumes, run the following command from the FSx CLI:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror break -destination-path DestSVM:DestVolName
....

. Grant access to the LUN by creating an initiator group containing the iSCSI IQN of the SQL Server Windows VM:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> igroup create -vserver DestSVM -igroup igroupName -protocol iSCSI -ostype windows -initiator IQN
....

. Finally, map the LUNs to the initiator group that you just created:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> lun mapping create -vserver DestSVM -path LUNPath igroup igroupName
....

. To find the path name, run the `lun show` command.
====

.Set up the Windows VM for iSCSI access and discover the file systems
[%collapsible]
====
. From the SQL Server VM, set up your iSCSI network adapter to communicate on the VMware Port Group that has been established with connectivity to the iSCSI target interfaces on your FSx instance.
. Open the iSCSI Initiator Properties utility and clear out the old connectivity settings on the Discovery, Favorite Targets, and Targets tabs.
. Locate the IP address(es) for accessing the iSCSI logical interface on the FSx instance/cluster. This can be found in the AWS console under Amazon FSx > ONTAP > Storage Virtual Machines.

+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image75.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
====

.Confirm SnapCenter communication with SQL Server Plug-in
[%collapsible]
====
With the SnapCenter database restored to its previous state, it automatically rediscovers the SQL Server hosts. For this to work correctly, keep in mind the following prerequisites:

* SnapCenter must be placed in Disaster Recover mode. This can be accomplished through the Swagger API or in Global Settings under Disaster Recovery.
* The FQDN of the SQL Server must be identical to the instance that was running in the on-premises datacenter.
* The original SnapMirror relationship must be broken.
* The LUNs containing the database must be mounted to the SQL Server instance and the database attached.

To confirm that SnapCenter is in Disaster Recovery mode, navigate to Settings from within the SnapCenter web client. Go to the Global Settings tab and then click Disaster Recovery. Make sure that the Enable Disaster Recovery checkbox is enabled.

=== Restore Oracle application data

The following process provides instructions on how to recover Oracle application data in VMware Cloud Services in AWS in the event of a disaster that renders the on-premises site inoperable.

Complete the following prerequisites to continue with the recovery steps:

. The Oracle Linux server VM has been restored to the VMware Cloud SDDC using Veeam Full Restore.
. A secondary SnapCenter server has been established and the SnapCenter database and configuration files have been restored using the steps outlined in this section link:#snapcenter-backup-and-restore-process-summary["SnapCenter backup and restore process summary."]

.Configure FSx for Oracle restore – Break the SnapMirror relationship
[%collapsible]
====
To make the secondary storage volumes hosted on the FSxN instance accessible to the Oracle servers, you must first break the existing SnapMirror relationship.

. After logging into the FSx CLI, run the following command to view the volumes filtered by the correct name.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> volume show -volume VolumeName*
....
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image77.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Run the following command to break the existing SnapMirror relationships.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror break -destination-path DestSVM:DestVolName
....
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image78.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Update the junction-path in the Amazon FSx web client:
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image79.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Add the junction path name and click Update. Specify this junction path when mounting the NFS volume from the Oracle server.

. Mount the NFS file system to the Oracle Linux Server. The directories for mounting the NFS share already exist on the Oracle Linux host.
. From the Oracle Linux server,  use the mount command to mount the NFS volumes.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> mount -t oracle_server_ip:/junction-path
....
+
Repeat this step for each volume associated with the Oracle databases.
+
[NOTE]
To make the NFS mount persistent upon rebooting, edit the `/etc/fstab` file to include the mount commands.

. Reboot the Oracle server. The Oracle databases should start up normally and be available for use.

=== Failback

Upon successful completion of the failover process outlined in this solution, SnapCenter and Veeam resume their backup functions running in AWS, and FSx for ONTAP is now designated as primary storage with no existing SnapMirror relationships with the original on-premises datacenter. After normal function has resumed on premises, you can use a process identical to the one outlined in this documentation to mirror data back to the on-premises ONTAP storage system.

As is also outlined in this documentation, you can configure SnapCenter to mirror the application data volumes from FSx for ONTAP to an ONTAP storage system residing on premises. Similarly, you can configure Veeam to replicate backup copies to Amazon S3 using a scale-out backup repository so that those backups are accessible to a Veeam backup server residing at the on-premises datacenter.

Failback is outside the scope of this documentation, but failback differs little from the detailed process outlined here.

== Conclusion

The use case presented in this documentation focuses on proven disaster recovery technologies that highlight the integration between NetApp and VMware. NetApp ONTAP storage systems provide proven data-mirroring technologies that allow organizations to design disaster recovery solutions that span on-premises and ONTAP technologies residing with the leading cloud providers.

FSx for ONTAP on AWS is one such solution that allows for seamless integration with SnapCenter and SyncMirror for replicating application data to the cloud. Veeam Backup & Replication is another well-known technology that integrates well with NetApp ONTAP storage systems and can provide failover to vSphere- native storage.

This solution presented a disaster recovery solution using guest connect storage from an ONTAP system hosting SQL Server and Oracle application data. SnapCenter with SnapMirror provides an easy-to-manage solution for protecting application volumes on ONTAP systems and replicating them to FSx or CVO residing in the cloud. SnapCenter is a DR-enabled solution for failing over all application data to VMware Cloud on AWS.
