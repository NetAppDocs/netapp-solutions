The following process provides instructions on how to recover a SQL Server in VMware Cloud Services in AWS in the event of a disaster that renders the on-premises site inoperable.

The following prerequisites are assumed to be complete in order to continue with the recovery steps:

. The Windows Server VM has been restored to the VMware Cloud SDDC using Veeam Full Restore.
. A secondary SnapCenter server has been established and SnapCenter database restore and configuration has been completed using the steps outlined in the section link:aws-guest-dr-snapcenter-db-backup.html#snapcenter-backup-and-restore-process-summary["SnapCenter backup and restore process summary."]

A summary of the SQL Server application data recovery process is as follows:

. Configure the VM in preparation for the restore process.
. Set up FSx for iSCSI access.
. Set up the Windows VM for iSCSI access.
. Attach the SQL Server database and bring it online.
. Confirm communication between SnapCenter and the SnapCenter SQL Server Plug-in.

== VM: Post restore configuration for SQL Server VM

After the restore of the VM is complete, you must configure networking and other items in preparation for rediscovering the host VM within SnapCenter.

. Assign new IP addresses for Management and iSCSI or NFS.
. Join the host to the Windows domain.
. Add the hostnames to DNS or to the hosts file on the SnapCenter server.

[NOTE]
If the SnapCenter plug-in was deployed using domain credentials different than the current domain, you must change the Log On account for the Plug-in for Windows Service on the SQL Server VM. After changing the Log On account, restart the SnapCenter SMCore, Plug-in for Windows, and Plug-in for SQL Server services.

[NOTE]
To automatically rediscover the restored VMs in SnapCenter, the FQDN must be identical to the VM that was originally added to the SnapCenter on premises.

== Configure FSx storage for SQL Server restore

To accomplish the disaster recovery restore process for a SQL Server VM, you must break the existing SnapMirror relationship from the FSx cluster and grant access to the volume. To do so, complete the following steps.

. To break the existing SnapMirror relationship for the SQL Server database and log volumes, run the following command from the FSx CLI:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror break -destination-path DestSVM:DestVolName
....

. Grant access to the LUN by creating an initiator group containing the iSCSI IQN of the SQL Server Windows VM:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> igroup create -vserver DestSVM -igroup igroupName -protocol iSCSI -ostype windows -initiator IQN
....

. Finally, map the LUNs to the initiator group that you just created:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> lun mapping create -vserver DestSVM -path LUNPath igroup igroupName
....

. To find the path name, run the `lun show` command.

== Set up the Windows VM for iSCSI access and discover the file systems

. From the SQL Server VM, set up your iSCSI network adapter to communicate on the VMware Port Group that has been established with connectivity to the iSCSI target interfaces on your FSx instance.
. Open the iSCSI Initiator Properties utility and clear out the old connectivity settings on the Discovery, Favorite Targets, and Targets tabs.
. Locate the IP address(es) for accessing the iSCSI logical interface on the FSx instance/cluster. This can be found in the AWS console under Amazon FSx > ONTAP > Storage Virtual Machines.

. From the Discovery tab, click Discover Portal and enter the IP addresses for your FSx iSCSI targets.

. On the Target tab, click Connect, select Enable Multi-Path if appropriate for your configuration and then click OK to connect to the target.

. Open the Computer Management utility and bring the disks online. Verify that they retain the same drive letters that they previously held.

== Attach the SQL Server databases

. From the SQL Server VM, open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and select Attach to start the process of connecting to the database.
+

. Click Add and navigate to the folder containing the SQL Server primary database file, select it, and click OK.
+

. If the transaction logs are on a separate drive, choose the folder that contains the transaction log.
. When finished, click OK to attach the database.

== Confirm SnapCenter communication with SQL Server Plug-in

With the SnapCenter database restored to its previous state, it automatically rediscovers the SQL Server hosts. For this to work correctly, keep in mind the following prerequisites:

* SnapCenter must be placed in Disaster Recover mode. This can be accomplished through the Swagger API or in Global Settings under Disaster Recovery.
* The FQDN of the SQL Server must be identical to the instance that was running in the on-premises datacenter.
* The original SnapMirror relationship must be broken.
* The LUNs containing the database must be mounted to the SQL Server instance and the database attached.

To confirm that SnapCenter is in Disaster Recovery mode, navigate to Settings from within the SnapCenter web client. Go to the Global Settings tab and then click Disaster Recovery. Make sure that the Enable Disaster Recovery checkbox is enabled.
