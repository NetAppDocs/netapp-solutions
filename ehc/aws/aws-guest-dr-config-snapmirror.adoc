SnapCenter can update SnapMirror relationships within the primary storage system (primary > mirror) and to secondary storage systems (primary > vault) for the purpose of long-term archiving and retention. To do so, you must establish and initialize a data replication relationship between a destination volume and a source volume using SnapMirror.

The source and destination ONTAP systems must be in networks that are peered using Amazon VPC peering, a transit gateway, AWS Direct Connect, or an AWS VPN.

The following steps are required for setting up SnapMirror relationships between an on-premises ONTAP system and FSx ONTAP:

* Record the source and destination intercluster logical interfaces.
* Establish cluster peering between ONTAP and FSx.
* Establish an SVM peering relationship.
* Create a snapshot retention policy.
* Create the destination volume in FSx.
* Create the SnapMirror relationships between source and destination volumes.
* Initialize SnapMirror relationships.

Refer to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/ONTAPGuide.pdf[FSx for ONTAP – ONTAP User Guide^] for more information on creating SnapMirror relationships with FSx.

== Record the source and destination Intercluster logical interfaces

For the source ONTAP system residing on-premises, you can retrieve the inter-cluster LIF information from System Manager or from the CLI.

. In ONTAP System Manager, navigate to the Network Overview page and retrieve the IP addresses of Type: Intercluster that are configured to communicate with the AWS VPC where FSx is installed.

. To retrieve the Intercluster IP addresses for FSx, log into the CLI and run the following command:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> network interface show -role intercluster
....
+

== Establish cluster peering between ONTAP and FSx

To establish cluster peering between ONTAP clusters, a unique passphrase entered at the initiating ONTAP cluster must be confirmed in the other peer cluster.

. Set up peering on the destination FSx cluster using the `cluster peer create` command. When prompted, enter a unique passphrase that is used later on the source cluster to finalize the creation process.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> cluster peer create -address-family ipv4 -peer-addrs source_intercluster_1, source_intercluster_2
Enter the passphrase:
Confirm the passphrase:
....

. At the source cluster,  you can establish the cluster peer relationship using either ONTAP System Manager or the CLI.  From ONTAP System Manager,  navigate to Protection > Overview and select Peer Cluster.
+

. In the Peer Cluster dialog box, fill out the required information:
.. Enter the passphrase that was used to establish the peer cluster relationship on the destination FSx cluster.
.. Select `Yes` to establish an encrypted relationship.
.. Enter the intercluster LIF IP address(es) of the destination FSx cluster.
.. Click Initiate Cluster Peering to finalize the process.
+

. Verify the status of the cluster peer relationship from the FSx cluster with the following command:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> cluster peer show
....
+

== Establish SVM peering relationship

The next step is to set up an SVM relationship between the destination and source storage virtual machines that contain the volumes that will be in SnapMirror relationships.

. From the source FSx cluster, use the following command from the CLI to create the SVM peer relationship:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> vserver peer create -vserver DestSVM -peer-vserver Backup -peer-cluster OnPremSourceSVM -applications snapmirror
....

. From the source ONTAP cluster, accept the peering relationship with either ONTAP System Manager or the CLI.
. From ONTAP System Manager, go to Protection > Overview and select Peer Storage VMs under Storage VM Peers.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image15.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. In the Peer Storage VM’s dialog box, fill out the required fields:
+
** The source storage VM
** The destination cluster
** The destination storage VM
+

. Click Peer Storage VMs to complete the SVM peering process.

== Create a snapshot retention policy

SnapCenter manages retention schedules for backups that exist as snapshot copies on the primary storage system. This is established when creating a policy in SnapCenter. SnapCenter does not manage retention policies for backups that are retained on secondary storage systems. These policies are managed separately through a SnapMirror policy created on the secondary FSx cluster and associated with the destination volumes that are in a SnapMirror relationship with the source volume.

When creating a SnapCenter policy, you have the option to specify a secondary policy label that is added to the SnapMirror label of each snapshot generated when a SnapCenter backup is taken.

[NOTE]
On the secondary storage, these labels are matched to policy rules associated with the destination volume for the purpose of enforcing retention of snapshots.

The following example shows a SnapMirror label that is present on all snapshots generated as part of a policy used for daily backups of our SQL Server database and log volumes.

For more information on creating SnapCenter policies for a SQL Server database, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-scsql/task_create_backup_policies_for_sql_server_databases.html[SnapCenter documentation^].

You must first create a SnapMirror policy with rules that dictate the number of snapshot copies to retain.

. Create the SnapMirror Policy on the FSx cluster.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror policy create -vserver DestSVM -policy PolicyName -type mirror-vault -restart always
....

. Add rules to the policy with SnapMirror labels that match the secondary policy labels specified in the SnapCenter policies.
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver DestSVM -policy PolicyName -snapmirror-label SnapMirrorLabelName -keep #ofSnapshotsToRetain
....
+
The following script provides an example of a rule that could be added to a policy:
+
....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver sql_svm_dest -policy Async_SnapCenter_SQL -snapmirror-label sql-ondemand -keep 15
....
+
[NOTE]
Create additional rules for each SnapMirror label and the number of snapshots to be retained (retention period).

== Create destination volumes

To create a destination volume on FSx that will be the recipient of snapshot copies from our source volumes, run the following command on FSx ONTAP:

....
FSx-Dest::> volume create -vserver DestSVM -volume DestVolName -aggregate DestAggrName -size VolSize -type DP
....

== Create the SnapMirror relationships between source and destination volumes

To create a SnapMirror relationship between a source and destination volume, run the following command on FSx ONTAP:

....
FSx-Dest::> snapmirror create -source-path OnPremSourceSVM:OnPremSourceVol -destination-path DestSVM:DestVol -type XDP -policy PolicyName
....

== Initialize the SnapMirror relationships

Initialize the SnapMirror relationship. This process initiates a new snapshot generated from the source volume and copies it to the destination volume.

To create a volume, run the following command on FSx ONTAP:

....
FSx-Dest::> volume create -vserver DestSVM -volume DestVolName -aggregate DestAggrName -size VolSize -type DP
....
