summary: VMware vSphere provides virtualized infrastructure in the datacenter and across all the major cloud providers. This ecosystem is ideal for disaster recovery scenarios for which virtualized compute stays consistent regardless of location. This solution uses VMware virtualized compute resources at both the datacenter location and in the VMware Cloud on AWS.

VMware vSphere provides virtualized infrastructure in the datacenter and across all the major cloud providers. This ecosystem is ideal for disaster recovery scenarios for which virtualized compute stays consistent regardless of location. This solution uses VMware virtualized compute resources at both the datacenter location and in the VMware Cloud on AWS.

== On-premises

This solution uses HPE Proliant DL360 Gen 10 Servers running VMware vSphere v7.0U3. We deployed six compute instances to provide adequate resources for our SQL server and Oracle servers.

We deployed 10 Windows Server 2019 VMs running SQL Server 2019 with varying database sizes and 10 Oracle Linux 8.5 VMs running Oracle 19c, again, with varying database sizes.

== Cloud

We deployed an SDDC in VMware Cloud on AWS with two hosts to provide adequate resources to run the virtual machines restored from our primary site.
