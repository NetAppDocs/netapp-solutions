SnapCenter allows for the backup and recovery of its underlying MySQL database and configuration data for the purpose of recovering the SnapCenter server in the case of a disaster. For our solution, we recovered the SnapCenter database and configuration on an AWS EC2 instance residing in our VPC. For more information on this step, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/sc-automation/rest_api_workflows_disaster_recovery_of_snapcenter_server.html[this link^].

== SnapCenter backup prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for SnapCenter backup:

* A volume and SMB share created on the on-premises ONTAP system to locate the backed-up database and configuration files.
* A SnapMirror relationship between the on-premises ONTAP system and FSx or CVO in the AWS account. This relationship is used for transporting the snapshot containing the backed-up SnapCenter database and configuration files.
* Windows Server installed in the cloud account, either on an EC2 instance or on a VM in the VMware Cloud SDDC.
* SnapCenter installed on the Windows EC2 instance or VM in VMware Cloud.

== SnapCenter backup and restore process summary

* Create a volume on the on-premises ONTAP system for hosting the backup db and config files.
* Set up a SnapMirror relationship between on-premises and FSx/CVO.
* Mount the SMB share.
* Retrieve the Swagger authorization token for performing API tasks.
* Start the db restore process.
* Use the xcopy utility to copy the db and config file local directory to the SMB share.
* On FSx, create a clone of the ONTAP volume (copied via SnapMirror from on-premises).
* Mount the SMB share from FSx to EC2/VMware Cloud.
* Copy the restore directory from the SMB share to a local directory.
* Run the SQL Server restore process from Swagger.

== Back up the SnapCenter database and configuration

SnapCenter provides a web client interface for executing REST API commands. For information on accessing the REST APIs through Swagger, see the SnapCenter documentation at https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/sc-automation/overview_rest_apis.html[this link^].

=== Log into Swagger and obtain authorization token

After you have navigated to the Swagger page, you must retrieve an authorization token to initiate the database restore process.

. Access the SnapCenter Swagger API web page at `https://<SnapCenter Server IP>:8146/swagger/`.

. Expand the Auth section and click Try it Out.

. In the UserOperationContext area, fill in the SnapCenter credentials and role and click Execute.

. In the Response body below, you can see the token. Copy the token text for authentication when executing the backup process.

=== Perform a SnapCenter database backup

Next go to the Disaster Recovery area on the Swagger page to begin the SnapCenter backup process.

. Expand the Disaster Recovery area by clicking it.

. Expand the `/4.6/disasterrecovery/server/backup` section and click Try it Out.
+

. In the SmDRBackupRequest section, add the correct local target path and select Execute to start the backup of the SnapCenter database and configuration.
+
[NOTE]
The backup process does not allow backing up directly to an NFS or CIFS file share.

=== Monitor the backup job from SnapCenter

Log into SnapCenter to review log files when starting the database restore process. Under the Monitor section, you can view the details of the SnapCenter server disaster recovery backup.

=== Use XCOPY utility to copy the database backup file to the SMB share

Next you must move the backup from the local drive on the SnapCenter server to the CIFS share that is used to SnapMirror copy the data to the secondary location located on the FSx instance in AWS. Use xcopy with specific options that retain the permissions of the files.

Open a command prompt as Administrator. From the command prompt, enter the following commands:

....
xcopy  <Source_Path>  \\<Destination_Server_IP>\<Folder_Path> /O /X /E /H /K
xcopy c:\SC_Backups\SnapCenter_DR \\10.61.181.185\snapcenter_dr /O /X /E /H /K
....
