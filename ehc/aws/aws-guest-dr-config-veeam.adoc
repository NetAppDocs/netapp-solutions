Veeam Backup & Replication software is used in the solution to back up our application virtual machines and archive a copy of the backups to an Amazon S3 bucket using a Veeam scale-out backup repository (SOBR). Veeam is deployed on a Windows server in this solution. For specific guidance on deploying Veeam, see the https://www.veeam.com/documentation-guides-datasheets.html[Veeam help Center Technical documentation^].

== Configure Veeam scale-out backup repository

After you deploy and license the software, you can create a scale-out backup repository (SOBR) as target storage for backup jobs. You should also include an S3 bucket as a backup of VM data offsite for disaster recovery.

See the following prerequisites before getting started.

. Create an SMB file share on your on-premises ONTAP system as the target storage for backups.
. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to include in the SOBR. This is a repository for the offsite backups.

=== Add ONTAP Storage to Veeam

First, add the ONTAP storage cluster and associated SMB/NFS filesystem as storage infrastructure in Veeam.

. Open the Veeam console and log in. Navigate to Storage Infrastructure and then select Add Storage.

. In the Add Storage wizard, select NetApp as the storage vendor and then select Data ONTAP.
. Enter the management IP address and check the NAS Filer box. Click Next.

. Add your credentials to access the ONTAP cluster.

. On the NAS Filer page choose the desired protocols to scan and select Next.
+

. Complete the Apply and Summary pages of the wizard and click Finish to begin the storage discovery process. After the scan completes, the ONTAP cluster is added along with the NAS filers as available resources.

. Create a backup repository using the newly discovered NAS shares. From Backup Infrastructure, select Backup Repositories and click the Add Repository menu item.
+

. Follow all steps in the New Backup Repository Wizard to create the repository. For detailed information on creating Veeam Backup Repositories, see the https://www.veeam.com/documentation-guides-datasheets.html[Veeam documentation^].

=== Add the Amazon S3 bucket as a backup repository

The next step is to add the Amazon S3 storage as a backup repository.

. Navigate to Backup Infrastructure > Backup Repositories. Click Add Repository.
+

. In the Add Backup Repository wizard, select Object Storage and then Amazon S3. This starts the New Object Storage Repository wizard.
+

. Provide a name for your object storage repository and click Next.
. In the next section, provide your credentials. You need an AWS Access Key and Secret Key.
+

. After the Amazon configuration loads, choose your datacenter, bucket, and folder and click Apply. Finally, click Finish to close out the wizard.

=== Create scale-out backup repository

Now that we have added our storage repositories to Veeam, we can create the SOBR to automatically tier backup copies to our offsite Amazon S3 object storage for disaster recovery.

. From Backup Infrastructure, select Scale-out Repositories and then click the Add Scale-out Repository menu item.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image37.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. In the New Scale-out Backup Repository provide a name for the SOBR and click Next.
. For the Performance Tier, choose the backup repository that contains the SMB share residing on your local ONTAP cluster.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image38.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. For the Placement Policy, choose either Data Locality or Performance based your requirements. Select next.
. For Capacity Tier we extend the SOBR with Amazon S3 object storage. For the purposes of disaster recovery, select Copy Backups to Object Storage as Soon as They are Created to ensure timely delivery of our secondary backups.
+

. Finally, select Apply and Finish to finalize creation of the SOBR.

=== Create the scale-out backup repository jobs

The final step to configuring Veeam is to create backup jobs using the newly created SOBR as the backup destination. Creating backup jobs is a normal part of any storage administratorâ€™s repertoire and we do not cover the detailed steps here. For more complete information on creating backup jobs in Veeam, see the https://www.veeam.com/documentation-guides-datasheets.html[Veeam Help Center Technical Documentation^].
