== Overview
// Describe WHAT problem this solution addresses.  What are the use cases(s) and how does it solve a problem?
// Use a bulleted list and keep it brief!

The 3-2-1 backup strategy is an industry accepted data protection method, providing a comprehensive approach to safeguarding valuable data.  This strategy is reliable and ensures that even if some unexpected disaster strikes, there will still be a copy of the data available.

The strategy is comprised of three fundamental rules:

1. Keep at least three copies of your data. This ensures that even if one copy is lost or corrupted, you still have at least two remaining copies to fall back on.

2. Store two backup copies on different storage media or devices. Diversifying storage media helps protect against device-specific or media-specific failures. If one device gets damaged or one type of media fails, the other backup copy remains unaffected.

3. Finally, ensure that at least one backup copy is offsite. Offsite storage serves as a fail-safe against localized disasters like fires or floods that could render onsite copies unusable.

This solution document covers a 3-2-1 backups solution using SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere (SCV) to create primary and secondary backups of our on-premises virtual machines and BlueXP backup and recovery for virtual machines to backup a copy of our data to cloud storage or StorageGRID.

=== Use Cases
This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Backup and restore of on-premises virtual machines and datastores using using SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
* Backup and restore of on-premises virtual machines and datastores, hosted on ONTAP clusters, and backed up to object storage using BlueXP backup and recovery for virtual machines.

=== NetApp ONTAP Data Storage
ONTAP is NetApp’s industry leading storage solution that offers unified storage whether you access over SAN or NAS protocols. The 3-2-1 backup strategy ensures on-premises data is protected on more than one media type and NetApp offers platforms ranging from high-speed flash to lower-cost media. 

image::bxp-scv-hybrid-40.png[ONTAP data storage]

For more information on all of NetApp’s hardware platform’s check out https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/[NetApp Data Storage].

=== SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere
The SnapCenter Plugin for VMware vSphere is a data protection offering which is tightly integrated with VMware vSphere and allows easy management of backup and restores for virtual machines. As part of that solution, SnapMirror provides a fast and reliable method to create a second immutable backup copy of virtual machine data on a secondary ONTAP storage cluster. With this architecture in place, virtual machine restore operations can easily be initiated from either the primary or secondary backup locations.

SCV is deployed as a linux virtual appliance using an OVA file. The plug-in now uses a remote plug-in
architecture. The remote plug-in runs outside of the vCenter server and is hosted on the SCV virtual appliance.

For detailed information on SCV refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere documentation].

=== BlueXP backup and recovery for virtual machines
BlueXP backup and recovery is a cloud based tool for data management that provides a single control plane for a wide range of backup and recovery operations across both on-premises and cloud environments. Part of the NetApp BlueXP backup and recovery suite is a feature that integrates with the SnapCenter Plugin for VMware vSphere (on-premises) to extend a copy of the data to object storage in the cloud. This establishes a third copy of the data offsite that is sourced from the primary or secondary storage backups. BlueXP backup and recovery makes it easy to set up storage policies that transfer copies of your data from either of these two on-prem locations.

Choosing between the primary and secondary backups as the source in BlueXP Backup and Recovery will result in one of two topologies being implemented:

*Fan-out Topology* – When a backup is initiated by the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere, a local snapshot is immediately taken. SCV then initiates a SnapMirror operation that replicates the most recent snapshot to the Secondary ONTAP cluster. In BlueXP Backup and Recovery, a policy specifies the primary ONTAP cluster as the source for a snapshot copy of the data to be transferred to object storage in your cloud provider of choice.

image::bxp-scv-hybrid-01.png[Fan-out topology,800,418]

*Cascading Topology* – Creating the primary and secondary data copies using SCV is identical to the fan-out topology mentioned above. However, this time a policy is created in BlueXP Backup and Recovery specifying that the backup to object storage will originate from the secondary ONTAP cluster.

image::bxp-scv-hybrid-02.png[Cascading topology]

BlueXP backup and recovery can create backup copies of on-premises ONTAP snapshots to AWS Glacier, Azure Blob, and GCP Archive storage.

image::bxp-scv-hybrid-03.png[Cascading topology]

In addition, you can use NetApp StorageGRID as the object storage backup target. For more on StorageGRID refer to the https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/storagegrid[StorageGRID landing page].

In this solution, we provide detailed instructions for deploying and validating a solution that utilizes SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere, along with BlueXP backup and recovery, to perform the backup and recovery of Windows and Linux virtual machines within a VMware vSphere cluster located in an on-premises data center. The virtual machines in this setup are stored on NFS datastores hosted by an ONTAP A300 storage cluster. Additionally, a separate ONTAP A300 storage cluster serves as a secondary destination for volumes replicated using SnapMirror. Furthermore, object storage hosted on Amazon Web Services and Azure Blob were employed as targets for a third copy of the data.

We will go over creating SnapMirror relationships for secondary copies of our backups managed by SCV and configuration of backup jobs in both SCV and BlueXP backup and recovery.

For detailed information on SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere documentation].

=== Establish SnapMirror relationships between ONTAP Clusters

SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere uses ONTAP SnapMirror technology to manage the transport of secondary SnapMirror and/or SnapVault copies to a secondary ONTAP Cluster.

SCV backup policies have the option of using SnapMirror or SnapVault relationships. The primary difference is that when using the SnapMirror option, the retention schedule configured for backups in the policy will be the same at the primary and secondary locations. SnapVault is designed for archiving and when using this option a separate retention schedule can be established with the SnapMirror relationship for the snapshot copies on the secondary ONTAP storage cluster.

Setting up SnapMirror relationships can be done in BlueXP where many of the steps are automated, or it can be done using System Manager and the ONTAP CLI. All of these methods are discussed below.

==== Establish SnapMirror relationships with BlueXP

The following steps must be completed from the BlueXP web console:

.Replication setup for primary and secondary ONTAP storage systems
[%collapsible]
==== 
Begin by logging into the BlueXP web console and navigating to the Canvas.

. Drag and drop the source (primary) ONTAP storage system onto the destination (secondary) ONTAP storage system.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-41.png[Drag and drop storage systems]

. From the menu that appears select *Replication*.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-42.png[Select replication]

. On the *Destination Peering Setup* page select the destination Intercluster LIFs to be used for the connection between storage systems.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-43.png[Choose Intercluster LIFs]

. On the *Destination Volume Name* page, first select the source volume and then fill out the destination volume name and select the destination SVM and aggregate. Click on *Next* to continue.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-44.png[Select source volume]
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-45.png[Destination volume details]

. Choose the max transfer rate for replication to occur at.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-46.png[Max transfer rate]

. Choose the policy that will determine the retention schedule for secondary backups. This policy can be created beforehand (see the manual process below in the *Create a snapshot retention policy* step) or can be changed after the fact if desired.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-47.png[Select retention policy]

. Finally, review all information and click on the *Go* button to start the replication setup process.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-48.png[Review and go]
====

==== Establish SnapMirror relationships with System Manager and ONTAP CLI
All required steps for establishing SnapMirror relationships can be accomplished with System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. The following section provides detailed information for both methods:

.Record the source and destination Intercluster logical interfaces
[%collapsible]
==== 
For the source and destination ONTAP clusters, you can retrieve the inter-cluster LIF information from System Manager or from the CLI.

. In ONTAP System Manager, navigate to the Network Overview page and retrieve the IP addresses of Type: Intercluster that are configured to communicate with the AWS VPC where FSx is installed.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image10.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. To retrieve the Intercluster IP addresses using the CLI run the following command:
+
....
ONTAP-Dest::> network interface show -role intercluster
....
====

.Establish cluster peering between ONTAP clusters
[%collapsible]
==== 
To establish cluster peering between ONTAP clusters, a unique passphrase entered at the initiating ONTAP cluster must be confirmed in the other peer cluster.

. Set up peering on the destination ONTAP cluster using the `cluster peer create` command. When prompted, enter a unique passphrase that is used later on the source cluster to finalize the creation process.
+
....
ONTAP-Dest::> cluster peer create -address-family ipv4 -peer-addrs source_intercluster_1, source_intercluster_2
Enter the passphrase:
Confirm the passphrase:
....

. At the source cluster,  you can establish the cluster peer relationship using either ONTAP System Manager or the CLI.  From ONTAP System Manager,  navigate to Protection > Overview and select Peer Cluster.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image12.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. In the Peer Cluster dialog box, fill out the required information:
.. Enter the passphrase that was used to establish the peer cluster relationship on the destination ONTAP cluster.
.. Select `Yes` to establish an encrypted relationship.
.. Enter the intercluster LIF IP address(es) of the destination ONTAP cluster.
.. Click Initiate Cluster Peering to finalize the process.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image13.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Verify the status of the cluster peer relationship from the destination ONTAP cluster with the following command:
+
....
ONTAP-Dest::> cluster peer show
....
====

.Establish SVM peering relationship
[%collapsible]
==== 
The next step is to set up an SVM relationship between the destination and source storage virtual machines that contain the volumes that will be in SnapMirror relationships.

. From the source FSx cluster, use the following command from the CLI to create the SVM peer relationship:
+
....
ONTAP-Dest::> vserver peer create -vserver DestSVM -peer-vserver Backup -peer-cluster OnPremSourceSVM -applications snapmirror
....

. From the source ONTAP cluster, accept the peering relationship with either ONTAP System Manager or the CLI.
. From ONTAP System Manager, go to Protection > Overview and select Peer Storage VMs under Storage VM Peers.
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image15.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. In the Peer Storage VM’s dialog box, fill out the required fields:
+
** The source storage VM
** The destination cluster
** The destination storage VM
+
image:dr-vmc-aws-image16.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Click Peer Storage VMs to complete the SVM peering process.
====

.Create a snapshot retention policy
[%collapsible]
==== 
SnapCenter manages retention schedules for backups that exist as snapshot copies on the primary storage system. This is established when creating a policy in SnapCenter. SnapCenter does not manage retention policies for backups that are retained on secondary storage systems. These policies are managed separately through a SnapMirror policy created on the secondary FSx cluster and associated with the destination volumes that are in a SnapMirror relationship with the source volume.

When creating a SnapCenter policy, you have the option to specify a secondary policy label that is added to the SnapMirror label of each snapshot generated when a SnapCenter backup is taken.

[NOTE]
On the secondary storage, these labels are matched to policy rules associated with the destination volume for the purpose of enforcing retention of snapshots.

The following example shows a SnapMirror label that is present on all snapshots generated as part of a policy used for daily backups of our SQL Server database and log volumes.

image:dr-vmc-aws-image17.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

For more information on creating SnapCenter policies for a SQL Server database, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-scsql/task_create_backup_policies_for_sql_server_databases.html[SnapCenter documentation^].

You must first create a SnapMirror policy with rules that dictate the number of snapshot copies to retain.

. Create the SnapMirror Policy on the FSx cluster.
+
....
ONTAP-Dest::> snapmirror policy create -vserver DestSVM -policy PolicyName -type mirror-vault -restart always
....

. Add rules to the policy with SnapMirror labels that match the secondary policy labels specified in the SnapCenter policies.
+
....
ONTAP-Dest::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver DestSVM -policy PolicyName -snapmirror-label SnapMirrorLabelName -keep #ofSnapshotsToRetain
....
+
The following script provides an example of a rule that could be added to a policy:
+
....
ONTAP-Dest::> snapmirror policy add-rule -vserver sql_svm_dest -policy Async_SnapCenter_SQL -snapmirror-label sql-ondemand -keep 15
....
+
[NOTE]
Create additional rules for each SnapMirror label and the number of snapshots to be retained (retention period).

====

.Create destination volumes
[%collapsible]
==== 
To create a destination volume on ONTAP that will be the recipient of snapshot copies from our source volumes, run the following command on the destination ONTAP cluster:

....
ONTAP-Dest::> volume create -vserver DestSVM -volume DestVolName -aggregate DestAggrName -size VolSize -type DP
....
====

.Create the SnapMirror relationships between source and destination volumes
[%collapsible]
==== 
To create a SnapMirror relationship between a source and destination volume, run the following command on the destination ONTAP cluster:

....
ONTAP-Dest::> snapmirror create -source-path OnPremSourceSVM:OnPremSourceVol -destination-path DestSVM:DestVol -type XDP -policy PolicyName
....
====

.Initialize the SnapMirror relationships
[%collapsible]
==== 
Initialize the SnapMirror relationship. This process initiates a new snapshot generated from the source volume and copies it to the destination volume.

To create a volume, run the following command on the destination ONTAP cluster:

....
ONTAP-Dest::> snapmirror initialize -destination-path DestSVM:DestVol
....
====

=== Configure the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere

Once installed, the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere can be accessed from the vCenter Server Appliance Management interface. SCV will manage backups for the NFS datastores mounted to the ESXi hosts and that contain the Windows and Linux VMs.

Review the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/scpivs44_protect_data_overview.html[Data protection workflow] section of the SCV documentation for more information on the steps involved in configuring backups.

To configure backups of your virtual machines and datastores the following steps will need to be completed from the plug-in interface. 

.Discovery ONTAP storage systems
[%collapsible]
=====
Discover the ONTAP storage clusters to be used for both primary and secondary backups.

. In the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere navigate to *Storage Systems* in the left-hand menu and click on the *Add* button. 
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-05.png[Storage systems]

. Fill out the credentials and platform type for the primary ONTAP storage system and click on *Add*. 
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-06.png[Add storage system]

. Repeat this procedure for the secondary ONTAP storage system.
=====

.Create SCV backup policies
[%collapsible]
=====
Policies specify the retention period, frequency and replication options for the backups managed by SCV. 

Review the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/scpivs44_create_backup_policies_for_vms_and_datastores.html[Create backup policies for VMs and datastores] section of the documentation for more information.

To create backup policies complete the following steps:

. In the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere navigate to *Policies* in the left-hand menu and click on the *Create* button.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-07.png[Policies]

. Specify a name for the policy, retention period, frequency and replication options, and snapshot label.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-08.png[Create policies]
+
NOTE: When creating a policy in the SnapCenter Plug-in you will see options for SnapMirror and SnapVault. If you choose SnapMirror, the retention schedule specified in the policy will be the same for both the primary and secondary snapshots. If you choose SnapVault, the retention schedule for the secondary snapshot will be based on a separate schedule implemented with the SnapMirror relationship. This is useful when you wish longer retention periods for secondary backups.
+
NOTE: Snapshot labels are useful in that they can be used to enact policies with a specific retention period for the SnapVault copies replicated to the secondary ONTAP cluster. When SCV is used with BlueXP Backup and Restore, the Snapshot label field must either be blank or [underline]#match# the label specified in the BlueXP backup policy.

. Repeat the procedure for each policy required. For example, separate policies for daily, weekly, and monthly backups.
=====

.Create resource groups
[%collapsible]
=====
Resource groups contain the datastores and virtual machines to be included in a backup job, along with the associated policy and backup schedule.

Review the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/scpivs44_create_resource_groups_for_vms_and_datastores.html[Create resource groups] section of the documentation for more information.

To create resource groups complete the following steps.

. In the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere navigate to *Resource Groups* in the left-hand menu and click on the *Create* button.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-09.png[Create resource groups]

. In the Create Resource Group wizard, enter a name and description for the group, as well as information required to receive notifications. Click on *Next*

. On the next page select the datastores and virtual machines that wish to be included in the backup job and then click on *Next*.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-10.png[Select datastores and virtual machines]
+
NOTE: You have the option to select specific VMs or entire datastores. Regardless of which you choose, the entire volume (and datastore) is backed up since the backup is the result of taking a snapshot of the underlying volume. In most cases, it is easiest to choose the entire datastore. However, if you wish to limit the list of available VMs when restoring, you can choose only a subset of VMs for backup.

. Choose options for spanning datastores for VMs with VMDKs that reside on multiple datastores and then click on *Next*.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-11.png[Spanning datastores]
+
NOTE: BlueXP backup and recovery does not currently support backing up VMs with VMDKs that span multiple datastores.

. On the next page select the policies that will be associated with the resource group and click on *Next*.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-12.png[Resource group policy]
+
NOTE: When backing up SCV managed snapshots to object storage using BlueXP backup and recovery, each resource group can only be associated with a single policy.

. Select a schedule that will determine at what times the backups will run. Click on *Next*. 
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-13.png[Resource group policy]

. Finally, review the summary page and then on *Finish* to complete the resource group creation.
=====

.Run a backup job
[%collapsible]
=====
In this final step, run a backup job and monitor its progress. At least one backup job must be successfully completed in SCV before resources can be discovered from BlueXP backup and recovery.

. In the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere navigate to *Resource Groups* in the left-hand menu.

. To initiate a backup job, select the desired resource group and click the *Run Now* button.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-14.png[Run a backup job]

. To monitor the backup job, navigate to *Dashboard* on the left hand menu. Under *Recent Job Activities* click on the Job ID number to monitor the job progress.
+
image::bxp-scv-hybrid-15.png[Monitor job progress]
=====

=== Configure Backups to Object Storage in BlueXP backup and recovery

For BlueXP to manage the data infrastructure effectively, it requires the prior installation of a Connector. The Connector executes the actions involved in discovering resources and managing data operations.

For more information on the BlueXP Connector refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Connectors] in the BlueXP documentation.

Once the connector is installed for the cloud provider being utilized, a graphic representation of the object storage will be viewable from the Canvas.

=== Restoring Virtual Machines in the case of data loss
Ensuring the safeguarding of your data is only one aspect of comprehensive data protection. Equally crucial is the ability to promptly restore data from any location in the event of data loss or a ransomware attack. This capability is vital for maintaining seamless business operations and meeting recovery point objectives.

NetApp offers a highly adaptable 3-2-1 strategy, providing customized control over retention schedules at the primary, secondary, and object storage locations. This strategy provides the flexibility to tailor data protection approaches to specific needs.

This section provides an overview of the data restoration process from both the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere and BlueXP backup and recovery for virtual machines. 

==== Restoring Virtual Machines from SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere
For this solution virtual machines were restored to original and alternate locations. Not all aspects of SCV's data restoration capabilities will be covered in this solution. For in depth information on all that SCV has to offer refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/scpivs44_restore_vms_from_backups.html[Restore VMs from backups] in the product documentation.
