Learn more about the capabilities that NetApp brings to the three (3) primary hyperscalers - from NetApp as a datastore to migrating workflows, extending/bursting to the cloud, backup/restore and disaster recovery.

== Introduction

Most IT organizations follow the hybrid cloud-first approach. These organizations are in a transformation phase and customers are evaluating their current IT landscape and then migrating their workloads to the cloud based on the assessment and discovery exercise.

The factors for customers migrating to the cloud can include elasticity and burst, data center exit, data center consolidation, end-of-life scenarios, mergers, acquisitions, and so on. The reason for this migration can vary based on each organization and their respective business priorities. When moving to the hybrid cloud, choosing the right storage in the cloud is very important in order to unleash the power of cloud deployment and elasticity.

Pick your cloud and let NetApp do the rest!

[[solutions]]
== NetApp / VMware Cloud Solutions
With NetApp and VMware cloud solutions, many use cases are simple to deploy in your hyperscaler of choice.  THes use cases include:

* Disaster recovery,
* Hosting workloads during data center maintenance,
* quick burst in which additional resources are required beyond whatâ€™s provisioned in the local data center,
* VMware site expansion,
* Fast migration to the cloud,
* Dev/test, and
* Modernization of apps leveraging cloud native technologies.: value
