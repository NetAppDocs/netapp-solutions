A comprehensive disaster recovery plan is critical for businesses in times of crisis. Many organizations leverage cloud computing for daily operations and disaster recovery. This proactive approach can reduce or eliminate expensive business disruptions.

This article describes how to use Veeam Backup & Replication to set up disaster recovery for on-premises VMware VMs to Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes (NetApp Volumes). 

== Overview

Google Cloud NetApp Volumes is a storage service from Google and NetApp that is available for Google Cloud. NetApp Volumes service provides high performance NFS/SMB storage. VMware certified NetApp Volumes NFS storage can be used as an external datastore for ESXi hosts in GCVE. Users are required to make a peering connection between their GCVE private cloud and NetApp Volumes project. There are no network charges resulting from storage access within a region. Users can create NetApp Volumes volumes in the Google Cloud console and enable deletion protection before mounting volumes as datastores to their ESXi hosts.

NetApp Volumes based NFS datastores can be used to replicate data from on-premises using any validated third-party solution that provides VM replication capability. By adding NetApp Volumes datastores, it enables cost optimized deployment instead of building a Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) based SDDC with a large number of ESXi hosts to accommodate the storage. This approach is called a “Pilot Light Cluster”. A pilot light cluster is a minimal GCVE host configuration (3 x GCVE ESXi hosts) along with NetApp Volumes datastores capacity to allow for independent scaling to meet capacity requirements.

The objective is to sustain a cost-effective infrastructure with just the core components to manage a failover. A pilot light cluster can expand and add more GCVE hosts in the event of a failover. Once the failover is resolved and normal operations resume, the pilot light cluster can reduce its scale, returning to a low-cost operational mode.

== Purposes of this document

This article describes how to use a Google Cloud NetApp Volumes datastore with Veeam Backup & Replication to set up disaster recovery for on-premises VMware VMs to GCVE using the Veeam VM replication software functionality. 

Veeam Backup & Replication is a backup and replication application for virtual environments. When virtual machines are replicated, Veeam Backup & Replication will create an exact copy of the VMs in the native VMware vSphere format on the target GCVE SDDC cluster.  Veeam Backup & Replication will keep the copy synchronized with the original VM. Replication provides the best recovery time objective (RTO) as there is a mounted copy of a VM at the DR site in a ready-to-start state.

This replication mechanism ensures that the workloads can quickly start in GCVE in the case of a disaster event. The Veeam Backup & Replication software also optimizes traffic transmission for replication over WAN and slow connections. In addition, it also filters out duplicate data blocks, zero data blocks, swap files, and “excluded VM guest OS files”. The software will also compress the replica traffic. To prevent replication jobs from consuming the entire network bandwidth, WAN accelerators and network throttling rules can be utilized. 

The replication process in Veeam Backup & Replication is job driven which means replication is performed by configuring replication jobs. In the case of a disaster event, failover can be triggered to recover the VMs by failing over to its replica copy. When failover is performed, a replicated VM takes over the role of the original VM. Failover can be performed to the latest state of a replica or to any of its known good restore points. This enables ransomware recovery or isolated testing as needed. Veeam Backup & Replication offers multiple options to handle different disaster recovery scenarios.

== Solution Overview

This solution covers the following high level steps:

. Create an NFS volume using Google Cloud NetApp Volumes
. Follow GCP process to create a GCVE datastore from the NetApp Volumes NFS volume.
. Set up a replication job to create VM replicas using Veeam Backup & Replication.
. Create a failover plan and perform failover.
. Switch back to production VMs once the disaster event is complete and the primary site is up.

NOTE: When creating a volume in NetApp Volumes, for use as a GCVE datastore, only NFS v3 is supported.

For more information on using NetApp Volumes NFS volumes as datastores for GCVE, check out https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/vmware-ecosystem/howto-cloud-volumes-datastores-gcve[Using NFS volume as vSphere datastore hosted by Google Cloud NetApp Volumes]. 

== Architecture

The following diagram shows the architecture of the solution presented in this documentation. A recommended best practice is to have a Veeam Backup & Replication server located at both the on-premises site and in the GCVE SDDC. Backup and recovery is performed and managed by the Veeam server on-premises, and replication is managed by the Veeam server in the GCVE SDDC. This architecture provides the highest availability when a failure occurs in the primary datacenter.

== Pre-requisites for Veeam Replication to GCVE and NetApp Volumes datastores

This solution requires the following components and configurations:

. NetApp Volumes has a Storage Pool available with enough free capacity to accommodate the NFS volume to be created.
. Veeam Backup and Replication software is running in an on-premises environment with appropriate network connectivity.
. Ensure the Veeam Backup & Replication backup VM is connected to the source as well as the target GCVE SDDC clusters.
. Ensure the Veeam Backup & Replication backup VM is connected to the Veeam Proxy server VMs at both the source and target GCVE clusters.
. The backup server must be able to resolve short names and connect to source and target vCenters.

Users are required to make a peering connection between their GCVE private cloud and NetApp Volumes project using the VPC Network peering or Private connections pages within the VMware Engine Cloud console UI.

NOTE: Veeam requires a GCVE solution user account with elevated privileges when adding the GCVE vCenter server to the Veeam Backup and Replication inventory. For more information refer to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) documentation, https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/private-clouds/classic-console/howto-elevate-privilege[Elevating VMware Engine privileges].

For additional information refer to https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/replica_limitations.html?ver=120[Considerations and Limitations] in the Veeam Backup & Replication documentation.

=== Replicate VMs to GCVE and execute failover plan, and failback

.Replicate VMs to NFS datastore in GCVE
[%collapsible]
====
Veeam Backup & Replication leverages VMware vSphere snapshot capabilities during replication, Veeam Backup & Replication requests VMware vSphere to create a VM snapshot. The VM snapshot is the point-in-time copy of a VM that includes virtual disks, system state, configuration and metadata. Veeam Backup & Replication uses the snapshot as a source of data for replication. 

To replicate VMs, complete the following steps:

. Open the Veeam Backup & Replication Console.

. On the *Home* tab, click on *Replication Job > Virtual machine...*
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image06.png[create vm replication job]

.Create a failover plan
[%collapsible]
====
When the initial replication or seeding is complete, create the failover plan. Failover plan helps in performing failover for dependent VMs one by one or as a group automatically. Failover plan is the blueprint for the order in which the VMs are processed including the boot delays. The failover plan also helps to ensure that critical dependent VMs are already running. 

After completing the initial replication or seeding, create a failover plan. This plan serves as a strategic blueprint for orchestrating the failover of dependent VMs, either individually or as a group. It defines the processing order of VMs, incorporates necessary boot delays, and ensures that critical dependent VMs are operational before others. By implementing a well-structured failover plan, organizations can streamline their disaster recovery process, minimizing downtime and maintaining the integrity of interdependent systems during a failover event.

When creating the plan, Veeam Backup & Replication automatically identifies and uses the most recent restore points to initiate the VM replicas.

NOTE: The failover plan can only be created once the initial replication is complete and the VM replicas are in Ready state.

NOTE: The maximum number of VMs that can be started simultaneously when running a failover plan is 10.

NOTE: During the failover process, the source VMs will not be powered off.

To create the *Failover Plan*, complete the following steps:

. On the *Home* view, Click on the *Failover Plan* button in the *Restore* section. In the drop down, select *VMware vSphere...*
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image16.png[Create failover plan]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *General* page of the *New Failover Plan* wizard, provide a name and a description to the plan. Pre and Post-failover scripts can be added as required. For instance, run a script to shutdown VMs before starting the replicated VMs.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image17.png[General page]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *Virtual Machines* page, click the button to *Add VM* and select *From replicas...*. Choose the VMs to be part of the failover plan, and then modify the VM boot order and any required boot delays to meet application dependencies.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image18.png[virtual machines page]
+
{nbsp}
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image19.png[Boot order and delays]
+
{nbsp}
+
Click on *Apply* to continue.

. Finally review all of the failover plan settings and click on *Finish* to create the failover plan.

====

.Run the failover plan
[%collapsible]
====
During failover, the source VM in the production site switches over to its replica at the disaster recovery site. As part of the process, Veeam Backup & Replication restores the VM replica to the required restore point and transfers all I/O activities from the source VM to its replica. Replicas serve not only for actual disasters but also for simulating DR drills. In failover simulation, the source VM continues running. Upon completion of necessary tests, the failover can be undone, returning operations to normal.

NOTE: Make sure network segmentation is in place to avoid IP conflicts during failover.

Complete the follow steps to start the failover plan:

. To get started, in the *Home* view, click on *Replicas > Failover Plans* in the left-hand menu and then on the *Start* button. Alternately, the *Start to...* button can be used to failover to a prior restore point.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image20.png[Start failover plan]
+
{nbsp}

. Monitor the progress of the failover in the *Executing failover plan* window.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image21.png[Monitor failover progress]
+
{nbsp}

NOTE: Veeam Backup & Replication stops all replication activities for the source VM until its replica is returned to the Ready state. 

For detailed information about failover plans, refer link:https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/failover_plan.html?ver=120[Failover Plans].
====

.Failback to the production site
[%collapsible]
====
Conducting a failover is considered an intermediate step and needs to be finalized based on the requirement. The options include the following:

* *Failback to production* - Revert to the original VM and synchronize all modifications made during the replica's active period back to the source VM.

NOTE: During failback, changes are transferred but not immediately applied. Select *Commit failback* once the original VM's functionality is verified. Alternatively, choose *Undo failback* to revert to the VM replica if the original VM exhibits unexpected behavior.

* *Undo failover* - Revert to the original VM, discarding all changes made to the VM replica during its operational period.

* *Permanent Failover* - Permanently switch from the original VM to its replica, establishing the replica as the new primary VM for ongoing operations.

In this scenario, the "Failback to production" option was selected. 

Complete the following steps to perform a failback to the production site:

. From the *Home* view, click on *Replicas > Active* in the left-hand menu. Select the VMs to be included and click on the *Failback to Production* button in the top menu.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image22.png[Start failback]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *Replica* page of the *Failback* wizard, select the replicas to include in the failback job.

. On the *Destination* page, select *Failback to the original VM* and click on *Next* to continue.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image23.png[Failback to original VM]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *Failback Mode* page, select *Auto* to start the failback as soon as possible.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image24.png[Failback mode]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *Summary* page, choose whether to *Power on target VM after restoring* and then click on Finish to start the failback job.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image25.png[Failback job summary]
+
{nbsp}

Failback commit finalizes the failback operation, confirming the successful integration of changes to the production VM. Upon commit, Veeam Backup & Replication resumes regular replication activities for the restored production VM. This changes the status of the restored replica from _Failback_ to _Ready_.

. To commit failback, navigate to *Replicas > Active*, select the VMs to be committed, right click and select *Commit failback*.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image26.png[Commit failback]
+
{nbsp}
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image27.png[Commit failback successful]
+
{nbsp}
After failback to production is successful, the VMs are all restored back to the original production site.

For detailed information about the failback process, refer Veeam documentation for link:https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/failover_failback.html?ver=120[Failover and Failback for replication].
