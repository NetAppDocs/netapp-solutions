A comprehensive disaster recovery plan is critical for businesses in times of crisis. Many organizations leverage cloud computing for daily operations and disaster recovery. This proactive approach can reduce or eliminate expensive business disruptions.

This article describes how to use Veeam Backup & Replication to set up disaster recovery for on-premises VMware VMs to Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes (NetApp Volumes). 

== Overview

Google Cloud NetApp Volumes is a storage service from Google and NetApp that is available for Google Cloud. NetApp Volumes service provides high performance NFS/SMB storage. VMware certified NetApp Volumes NFS storage can be used as an external datastore for ESXi hosts in GCVE. Users are required to connect NetApp Volumes and GCVE services through VPC network peering (PSA). There are no network charges resulting from storage access within a region. Users can create NetApp Volumes volumes in the Google Cloud console and enable deletion protection before mounting volumes as datastores to their ESXi hosts.

NetApp Volumes based NFS datastores can be used to replicate data from on-premises using any validated third-party solution that provides VM replication capability. By adding NetApp Volumes datastores, it enables cost optimized deployment instead of building a Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) based SDDC with a large number of ESXi hosts to accommodate the storage. This approach is called a “Pilot Light Cluster”. A pilot light cluster is a minimal GCVE host configuration (3 x GCVE ESXi hosts) along with NetApp Volumes datastores capacity to allow for independent scaling to meet capacity requirements.

The objective is to sustain a cost-effective infrastructure with just the core components to manage a failover. A pilot light cluster can expand and add more GCVE hosts in the event of a failover. Once the failover is resolved and normal operations resume, the pilot light cluster can reduce its scale, returning to a low-cost operational mode.

== Purposes of this document

This article describes how to use a Google Cloud NetApp Volumes datastore with Veeam Backup & Replication to set up disaster recovery for on-premises VMware VMs to GCVE using the Veeam VM replication software functionality. 

Veeam Backup & Replication is a backup and replication application for virtual environments. When virtual machines are replicated, Veeam Backup & Replication will create an exact copy of the VMs in the native VMware vSphere format on the target GCVE SDDC cluster.  Veeam Backup & Replication will keep the copy synchronized with the original VM. Replication provides the best recovery time objective (RTO) as there is a mounted copy of a VM at the DR site in a ready-to-start state.

This replication mechanism ensures that the workloads can quickly start in GCVE in the case of a disaster event. The Veeam Backup & Replication software also optimizes traffic transmission for replication over WAN and slow connections. In addition, it also filters out duplicate data blocks, zero data blocks, swap files, and “excluded VM guest OS files”. The software will also compress the replica traffic. To prevent replication jobs from consuming the entire network bandwidth, WAN accelerators and network throttling rules can be utilized. 

The replication process in Veeam Backup & Replication is job driven which means replication is performed by configuring replication jobs. In the case of a disaster event, failover can be triggered to recover the VMs by failing over to its replica copy. When failover is performed, a replicated VM takes over the role of the original VM. Failover can be performed to the latest state of a replica or to any of its known good restore points. This enables ransomware recovery or isolated testing as needed. Veeam Backup & Replication offers multiple options to handle different disaster recovery scenarios.

== Solution Overview

This solution covers the following high level steps:

. Create an NFS volume using Google Cloud NetApp Volumes
. Follow GCP process to create a GCVE datastore from the NetApp Volumes NFS volume.
. Set up a replication job to create VM replicas using Veeam Backup & Replication.
. Create a failover plan and perform failover.
. Switch back to production VMs once the disaster event is complete and the primary site is up.

For more information on using NetApp Volumes NFS volumes as datastores for GCVE, check out https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/vmware-ecosystem/howto-cloud-volumes-datastores-gcve[Using NFS volume as vSphere datastore hosted by Google Cloud NetApp Volumes]. 

== Architecture

The following diagram shows the architecture of the solution presented in this documentation. A recommended best practice is to have a Veeam Backup & Replication server located at both the on-premises site and in the GCVE SDDC. Backup and recovery is performed and managed by the Veeam server on-premises, and replication is managed the Veeam server in the GCVE SDDC. This architecture provides the highest availability when a failure occurs in the primary datacenter.

== Pre-requisites for Veeam Replication to GCVE and NetApp Volumes datastores

This solution requires the following components and configurations:

. NetApp volumes has a Storage Pool available with enough free capacity to accommodate the NFS volume to be created.
. Veeam Backup and Replication software is running in an on-premises environment with appropriate network connectivity.
. Ensure the Veeam Backup & Replication backup VM is connected to the source as well as the target GCVE SDDC clusters.
. Ensure the Veeam Backup & Replication backup VM is connected to the Veeam Proxy server VMs at both the source and target GCVE clusters.
. The backup server must be able to resolve short names and connect to source and target vCenters.

NOTE: Veeam requires a GCVE solution user account with elevated privileges when adding the GCVE vCenter server to the Veeam Backup and Replication inventory. For more information refer to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) documentation at https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/private-clouds/classic-console/howto-elevate-privilege[Elevating VMware Enginer priviliges].

== Deployment steps

The following sections outline the deployment steps to implement and test a VMware Site Recovery Manager configuration with ONTAP storage system.

=== Create NetApp Volumes NFS volume and datastore for GCVE
Refer to https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/vmware-ecosystem/howto-cloud-volumes-datastores-gcve[Using NFS volume as vSphere datastore hosted by Google Cloud NetApp Volumes] for an overview of how to Google Cloud NetApp Volumes as a datastore for GCVE.

Complete the following steps to create and use an NFS datastore for GCVE using NetApp Volumes:

.Create NetApp Volumes NFS volume
[%collapsible]
====
Google Cloud NetApp Volumes is accessed from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

Refer to https://cloud.google.com/netapp/volumes/docs/configure-and-use/volumes/create-volume[Create a volume] in the Google Cloud NetApp Volumes documentation for detailed information on this step.

. In a web browser, navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and log into your GCP console. Search for *NetApp Volumes* to get started.

. In the *NetApp Volumes* management interface, click on *Create* to get started creating an NFS volume.

.Mount the NFS datastore in GCVE
[%collapsible]
====
At the time of this writing the process to mount a datastore in GCVE requires opening a GCP support ticket to have the volume mounted as an NFS datastore.

Refer to https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/vmware-ecosystem/howto-cloud-volumes-datastores-gcve[Using NFS volume as vSphere datastore hosted by Google Cloud NetApp Volumes] for more information.

=== Replicate VMs to GCVE and execute failover, failback plans

.Replicate VMs to NFS datastore in GCVE
[%collapsible]
====
Veeam Backup & Replication leverages VMware vSphere snapshot capabilities during replication, Veeam Backup & Replication requests VMware vSphere to create a VM snapshot. The VM snapshot is the point-in-time copy of a VM that includes virtual disks, system state, configuration and metadata. Veeam Backup & Replication uses the snapshot as a source of data for replication. 

To replicate VMs, complete the following steps:

. Open the Veeam Backup & Replication Console.

. On the *Home* tab, click on *Replication Job > Virtual machine...*
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image06.png[create vm replication job]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *Name* page of the *New Replication Job* wizard, specify a job name and select the appropriate advanced control checkboxes.

* Select the Replica seeding check box if connectivity between on-premises and GCP has restricted bandwidth.
* Select the Network remapping (for GCVE SDDC sites with different networks) check box if segments on the GCVE SDDC do not match that of the on-premises site networks.
* Select the Replica re-IP (for DR sites with different IP addressing scheme) check box if the IP addressing scheme in the on-premises production site differs from the scheme in the target GCVE site.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image07.png[name page]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *Virtual Machines* page, select the VMs to be replicated to the NetApp Volumes datastore attached to a GCVE SDDC. Click *Add*, then in the *Add Object* window select the necessary VMs or VM containers and click *Add*. Click *Next*.

NOTE: The Virtual machines can be placed on vSAN to fill the available vSAN datastore capacity. In a pilot light cluster, the usable capacity of a 3-node vSAN cluster will be limited. The rest of the data can be easily placed on Google Cloud NetApp Volumes datastores so that the VMs can be recovered, and the cluster can later be expanded to meet the CPU/mem requirements.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image08.png[select VMs to be replicated]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *Destination* page, select the destination as the GCVE SDDC cluster / hosts and the appropriate resource pool, VM folder and GCNV datastore for the VM replicas. Click *Next* to continue.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image09.png[select destination details]
+
{nbsp}

. On the *Network* page, create the mapping between source and destination virtual network as needed.
+
image::dr-veeam-gcnv-image10.png[network mapping]
+
{nbsp}






. In the *Job Settings* step, specify the backup repository that will store metadata for VM replicas, retention policy and so on. 

. Update the *Source* and *Target* proxy servers in the *Data Transfer* step and leave *Automatic* selection (default) and keep *Direct* option selected and click *Next*.

. At the *Guest Processing* step, select *Enable application-aware processing* option as needed. Click *Next*.
+
image::dr-veeam-anf-image6.png[]

. Choose the replication schedule to run the replication job to run on a regular basis.
+
image::dr-veeam-anf-image7.png[]

. At the *Summary* step of the wizard, review details of the replication job. To start the job right after the wizard is closed, select the *Run the job when I click Finish* check box, otherwise leave the check box unselected. Then click *Finish* to close the wizard.
+
image::dr-veeam-anf-image8.png[]

Once the replication job starts, the VMs with the suffix specified will be populated on the destination AVS SDDC cluster / host.

====

Create a failover plan
[%collapsible]
====
When the initial replication or seeding is complete, create the failover plan. Failover plan helps in performing failover for dependent VMs one by one or as a group automatically. Failover plan is the blueprint for the order in which the VMs are processed including the boot delays. The failover plan also helps to ensure that critical dependant VMs are already running. 

To create the plan, navigate to the new sub section called *Replicas* and select *Failover Plan*. Choose the appropriate VMs. Veeam Backup & Replication will look for the closest restore points to this point in time and use them to start VM replicas. 

NOTE: The failover plan can only be added once the initial replication is complete and the VM replicas are in Ready state.

NOTE: The maximum number of VMs that can be started simultaneously when running a failover plan is 10

NOTE: During the failover process, the source VMs will not be powered off

To create the *Failover Plan*, do the following:

. On the Home view. Right click the Replicas node and select Failover Plans > Failover Plan > VMware vSphere.
+
image::dr-veeam-anf-image10.png[]

. Next provide a name and a description to the plan. Pre and Post-failover script can be added as required. For instance, run a script to shutdown VMs before starting the replicated VMs.
+
image::dr-veeam-anf-image11.png[]

. Add the VMs to the plan and modify the VM boot order and boot delays to meet the application dependencies.
+
image::dr-veeam-anf-image12.png[]

====

.Step 3: Run the failover plan
[%collapsible]
====
During failover, the source VM in the production site is switched over to its replica at the disaster recovery site. As part of the failover process, Veeam Backup & Replication restores the VM replica to the required restore point and moves all I/O activities from the source VM to its replica. Replicas can be used not only in case of a disaster, but also to simulate DR drills. During failover simulation, the source VM remains running. Once all the necessary tests have been conducted, you can undo the failover and return to normal operations.

NOTE: Make sure network segmentation is in place to avoid IP conflicts during failover.

To start the failover plan, simply click in *Failover Plans* tab and right click on your failover plan. Select **Start*. This will failover using the latest restore points of VM replicas. To fail over to specific restore points of VM replicas, select *Start to*. 

image::dr-veeam-anf-image13.png[]

image::dr-veeam-anf-image14.png[]

The state of the VM replica changes from Ready to Failover and VMs will start on the destination Azure VMware Solution (AVS) SDDC cluster / host. 

image::dr-veeam-anf-image15.png[]

Once the failover is complete, the status of the VMs will change to “Failover”.

image::dr-veeam-anf-image16.png[]

NOTE: Veeam Backup & Replication stops all replication activities for the source VM until its replica is returned to the Ready state. 

For detailed information about failover plans, refer link:https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/failover_plan.html?ver=120[Failover Plans].
====

.Step 4: Failback to the Production site
[%collapsible]
====
When the failover plan is running, it is considered as an intermediate step and needs to be finalized based on the requirement. The options include the following:

* *Failback to production* - switch back to the original VM and transfer all changes that took place while the VM replica was running to the original VM.

NOTE: When you perform failback, changes are only transferred but not published. Choose *Commit failback* (once the original VM is confirmed to work as expected) or Undo failback to get back to the VM replica If the original VM is not working as expected.

* *Undo failover* - switch back to the original VM and discard all changes made to the VM replica while it was running.

* *Permanent Failover* - permanently switch from the original VM to a VM replica and use this replica as the original VM.

In this demo, Failback to production was chosen. Failback to the original VM was selected during the Destination step of the wizard and “Power on VM after restoring” check box was enabled.

image::dr-veeam-anf-image17.png[]

image::dr-veeam-anf-image18.png[]

image::dr-veeam-anf-image19.png[]

image::dr-veeam-anf-image20.png[]

Failback commit is one of the ways to finalize failback operation. When failback is committed, it confirms that the changes sent to the VM which is failed back (the production VM) are working as expected. After the commit operation, Veeam Backup & Replication resumes replication activities for the production VM.

For detailed information about the failback process, refer Veeam documentation for link:https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/failover_failback.html?ver=120[Failover and Failback for replication].

image::dr-veeam-anf-image21.png[]

After failback to production is successful, the VMs are all restored back to the original production site.

== Conclusion

Azure NetApp Files datastore capability enables Veeam or any validated third-party tool to provide a low-cost DR solution by leveraging Pilot light clusters instead of standing up a large cluster only to accommodate VM replicas. This provides an efficacious way to handle a tailored, customized disaster recovery plan and to reuse existing backup products in house for DR, enabling cloud-based disaster recovery by exiting on-premises DR datacenters. It is possible to failover by clicking a button in case of disaster or to failover automatically if a disaster occurs.
