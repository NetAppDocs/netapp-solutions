link:https://www.vmware.com/products/vmc-on-aws.html[VMware Cloud on AWS] provides for a cloud native experience for VMware based workloads in the AWS ecosystem. Each VMware Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) runs in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and provides a full VMware stack (including vCenter Server), NSX-T software-defined networking, vSAN software-defined storage, and one or more ESXi hosts that provide compute and storage resources to your workloads.

This section describes how to set up and manage VMware Cloud on AWS and use it in combination with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP and/or Cloud Volumes ONTAP on AWS with in-guest storage.

NOTE: In-guest storage is the only supported method of connecting Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP and Cloud Volumes ONTAP to VMware Cloud on AWS.

The setup process can be broken down into three parts:

. Register for an link:https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon Web Services Account].
. Register for a link:https://customerconnect.vmware.com/home[My VMware] account.
. Provision SDDC in VMWare Cloud.

== Register for an AWS account

You need an AWS account to get started, assuming there isn’t one created already. New or existing, you need administrative privileges in the account for many steps in this procedure. See this link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html[link] for more information regarding AWS credentials.

== Register for a My VMware account

For access to VMware’s cloud portfolio (including VMware Cloud on AWS), you need a VMware customer account or a My VMware account. If you have not already done so, create a VMware account link:https://customerconnect.vmware.com/account-registration[here].

== Provision SDDC in VMware Cloud

After the VMware account is configured and proper sizing is performed, deploying a Software-Defined Data Center is the obvious next step for using the VMware Cloud on AWS service. To create an SDDC, pick an AWS region to host it, give the SDDC a name, and specify how many ESXi hosts you want the SDDC to contain. If you don't already have an AWS account, you can still create a starter configuration SDDC that contains a single ESXi host.

. Log into the VMware Cloud Console using your existing or newly created VMware credentials.

. Configure the AWS region, deployment, and host type and the SDDC name:

. Connect to the desired AWS account and execute the AWS Cloud Formation stack.

NOTE: Single-host configuration is used in this validation.

. Select the desired AWS VPC to connect the VMC environment with.

. Configure the VMC Management Subnet; this subnet contains VMC-managed services like vCenter, NSX, and so on. Do not choose an overlapping address space with any other networks that need connectivity to the SDDC environment. Finally, follow the recommendations for CIDR size notated below.

. Review and acknowledge the SDDC configuration, and then click deploy the SDDC.

The deployment process typically takes approximately two hours to complete.

. After completion, the SDDC is ready for use.
