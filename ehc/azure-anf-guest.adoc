Azure NetApp Files shares can be mounted from VMs that are created in the Azure VMware Solution SDDC environment. The volumes can also be mounted on the Linux client and mapped on the Windows client because Azure NetApp Files supports SMB and NFS protocols. Azure NetApp Files volumes can be set up in five simple steps.

Azure NetApp Files and Azure VMware Solution must be in the same Azure region.

== Create and mount Azure NetApp Files volumes

To create and mount Azure NetApp Files volumes, complete the following steps:

. Log in to the Azure Portal and access Azure NetApp Files. Verify access to the Azure NetApp Files service and register the Azure NetApp Files Resource Provider by using the _az provider register --namespace Microsoft.NetApp â€“wait_ command. After registration is complete, create a NetApp account.

. After the NetApp account is created, set up the capacity pools with the required service level and size.

. Configure the delegated subnet for Azure NetApp Files and specify this subnet while creating the volumes. For detailed steps to create delegated subnet, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet[Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files].

. Add an SMB volume by using the Volumes blade under the Capacity Pools blade. Make sure the Active Directory connector is configured prior to creating the SMB volume.

. After the connectivity is in place, the volume can be mounted and used for application data.
+
To accomplish this, from the Azure portal, click the Volumes blade, and then select the volume to mount and access the mount instructions. Copy the path and use the Map Network Drive option to mount the volume on the VM running on Azure VMware Solution SDDC.

. To mount NFS volumes on Linux VMs running on Azure VMware Solution SDDC, use this same process. Use volume reshaping or dynamic service level capability to meet the workload demands.
