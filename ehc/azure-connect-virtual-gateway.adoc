To create a new Azure Virtual Network (VNet), select the Azure VNet Connect tab. Alternatively, you can create one manually from the Azure portal by using the Create Virtual Network wizard:

. Go to Azure VMware Solution private cloud and access Connectivity under the Manage option.
. Select Azure VNet Connect.
. To create a new VNet, select the Create New option.
+
This feature allows a VNet to be connected to the Azure VMware Solution private cloud. The VNet enables communication between workloads in this virtual network by automatically creating required components (for example, jump box, shared services such as Azure NetApp Files, and Cloud Volume ONTAP) to the private cloud created in Azure VMware Solution over ExpressRoute.
+
*Note:* The VNet address space should not overlap with the private cloud CIDR.

. Provide or update the information for the new VNet and select OK.

The VNet with the provided address range and gateway subnet is created in the designated subscription and resource group.

NOTE: If you create a VNet manually, create a virtual network gateway with the appropriate SKU and ExpressRoute as the gateway type. After the deployment is complete, connect the ExpressRoute connection to the virtual network gateway containing Azure VMware Solution private cloud using the authorization key.
