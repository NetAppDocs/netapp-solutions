[.lead]
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP files shares and LUNs can be mounted from VMs that are created within the VMware SDDC environment at  VMware Cloud at AWS. The volumes can also be mounted on the Linux client and mapped on the Windows client using the NFS or SMB protocol, and LUNS can be accessed on Linux or Windows clients as block devices when mounted over iSCSI. Amazon FSx for the NetApp ONTAP file system can be set up quickly with the following steps.

NOTE: Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP and VMware Cloud on AWS must be in the same availability zone to achieve better performance and avoid data transfer charges between availability zones.

== Create and mount Amazon FSx for ONTAP volumes

To create and mount Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, complete the following steps:

. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx console] and choose Create file system to start the file system creation wizard.

. On the Select File System Type page, choose Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, and then choose Next. The Create File System page appears.

+
NOTE: In the Networking section, for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), choose the appropriate VPC and preferred subnets along with the route table. In this case, vmcfsx2.vpc is selected from the dropdown.

. In the Security & Encryption section, for the Encryption Key, choose the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key that protects the file system's data at rest. For the File System Administrative Password, enter a secure password for the fsxadmin user.
+
image:aws-fsx-guest-5.png[]

. In virtual machine and specify the password to use with vsadmin for administering ONTAP using REST APIs or the CLI. If no password is specified, a fsxadmin user can be used for administering the SVM. In the Active Directory section, make sure to join Active Directory to the SVM for provisioning SMB shares. In the Default Storage Virtual Machine Configuration section, provide a name for the storage in this validation, SMB shares are provisioned using a self-managed Active Directory domain.
+

. In the Default Volume Configuration section, specify the volume name and size. This is an NFS volume. For Storage Efficiency, choose Enabled to turn on the ONTAP storage efficiency features (compression, deduplication, and compaction) or Disabled to turn them off.
+
image:aws-fsx-guest-7.png[]

. Review the file system configuration shown on the Create File System page.

. Click Create File System.

For more detailed information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/getting-started.html[Getting started with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP].

After the file system is created as above, create the volume with the required size and protocol.

. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx console].
. In the left navigation pane, choose File systems, and then choose the ONTAP file system that you want to create a volume for.
. Select the Volumes tab.
. Select the Create Volume tab.
. The Create Volume dialog box appears.

For demo purposes, an NFS volume is created in this section that can be easily mounted on VMs running on VMware cloud on AWS. nfsdemovol01 is created as depicted below:

=== Mount FSx ONTAP volume on Linux client

To mount the FSx ONTAP volume created in the previous step. from the Linux VMs within VMC on AWS SDDC, complete the following steps:

. Connect to the designated Linux instance.
. Open a terminal on the instance using Secure Shell (SSH) and log in with the appropriate credentials.
. Make a directory for the volume's mount point with the following command:
+
  $ sudo mkdir /fsx/nfsdemovol01

. Mount the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP NFS volume to the directory that is created in the previous step.
+
  sudo mount -t nfs nfsvers=4.1,198.19.254.239:/nfsdemovol01 /fsx/nfsdemovol01
+
image:aws-fsx-guest-20.png[]

. Once executed, run the df command to validate the mount.
+

=== Attach FSx ONTAP volumes to Microsoft Windows clients

To manage and map file shares on an Amazon FSx file system, the Shared Folders GUI must be used.

. Open the Start menu and run fsmgmt.msc using Run As Administrator. Doing this opens the Shared Folders GUI tool.
. Click Action > All tasks and choose Connect to Another Computer.
. For Another Computer, enter the DNS name for the storage virtual machine (SVM). For example, FSXSMBTESTING01.FSXTESTING.LOCAL is used in this example.
+
NOTE: Tp find the SVM's DNS name on the Amazon FSx console, choose Storage Virtual Machines, choose SVM, and then scroll down to Endpoints to find the SMB DNS name. Click OK. The Amazon FSx file system appears in the list for the Shared Folders.
+
image:aws-fsx-guest-22.png[]

. In the Shared Folders tool, choose Shares in the left pane to see the active shares for the Amazon FSx file system.
+
image:aws-fsx-guest-23.png[]

. Now choose a new share and complete the Create a Shared Folder wizard.
+

+
To learn more about creating and managing SMB shares on an Amazon FSx file system, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/create-smb-shares.html[Creating SMB Shares].

. After connectivity is in place, the SMB share can be attached and used for application data. To accomplish this, Copy the share path and use the Map Network Drive option to mount the volume on the VM running on VMware Cloud on the AWS SDDC.

== Connect a FSx for NetApp ONTAP LUN to a host using iSCSI

iSCSI traffic for FSx traverses the VMware Transit Connect/AWS Transit Gateway via the routes provided in the previous section. To configure a LUN in Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, follow the documentation found link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/supported-fsx-clients.html[here].

On Linux clients, make sure that the iSCSI daemon is running. After the LUNs are provisioned, refer to the detailed guidance on iSCSI configuration with Ubuntu (as an example) link:https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-iscsi[here].

In this paper, connecting the iSCSI LUN to a Windows host is depicted:

=== Provision a LUN in FSx for NetApp ONTAP:

. Access the NetApp ONTAP CLI using the management port of the FSx for the ONTAP file system.

. Create the LUNs with the required size as indicated by the sizing output.
+
  FsxId040eacc5d0ac31017::> lun create -vserver vmcfsxval2svm -volume nimfsxscsivol -lun nimofsxlun01 -size 5gb -ostype windows -space-reserve enabled
+
In this example, we created a LUN of size 5g (5368709120).

. Create the necessary igroups to control which hosts have access to specific LUNs.

Connect the newly provisioned LUN to a Windows VM:
+
To connect the new LUN tor a Windows host residing on VMware cloud on AWS SDDC, complete the following steps:

.. RDP to the Windows VM hosted on the VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC.
.. Navigate to Server Manager > Dashboard > Tools > iSCSI Initiator to open the iSCSI Initiator Properties dialog box.
.. From the Discovery tab, click Discover Portal or Add Portal and then enter the IP address of the iSCSI target port.
.. From the Targets tab, select the target discovered and then click Log On or Connect.
.. Select Enable Multipath, and then select “Automatically Restore This Connection When the Computer Starts” or “Add This Connection to the List of Favorite Targets”. Click Advanced.
+
NOTE: The Windows host must have an iSCSI connection to each node in the cluster. The native DSM selects the best paths to use.
+
image:aws-fsx-guest-30.png[]

LUNs on the storage virtual machine (SVM) appear as disks to the Windows host. Any new disks that are added are not automatically discovered by the host. Trigger a manual rescan to discover the disks by completing the following steps:

. Open the Windows Computer Management utility: Start > Administrative Tools > Computer Management.
. Expand the Storage node in the navigation tree.
. Click Disk Management.
. Click Action > Rescan Disks.
+
image:aws-fsx-guest-31.png[]

When a new LUN is first accessed by the Windows host, it has no partition or file system. Initialize the LUN and, optionally, format the LUN with a file system by completing the following steps:

. Start Windows Disk Management.
. Right-click the LUN, and then select the required disk or partition type.
. Follow the instructions in the wizard. In this example, drive F: is mounted.
