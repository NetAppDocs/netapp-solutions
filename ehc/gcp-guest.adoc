GCP supports guest connected NetApp storage with Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) or Cloud Volumes Service (CVS).

[[gcp-cvo]]

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO)

Cloud volumes ONTAP, or CVO, is the industry-leading cloud data management solution built on NetApp’s ONTAP storage software, available natively on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

It is a software-defined version of ONTAP that consumes cloud-native storage, allowing you to have the same storage software in the cloud and on-premises, reducing the need to retrain you IT staff in all-new methods to manage your data.

CVO gives customers the ability to seamlessly move data from the edge, to the data center, to the cloud and back, bringing your hybrid cloud together — all managed with a single-pane management console, NetApp Cloud Manager.

By design, CVO delivers extreme performance and advanced data management capabilities to satisfy even your most demanding applications in the cloud

=====

Cloud Volumes ONTAP shares and LUNs can be mounted from VMs that are created in the GCVE private cloud environment. The volumes can also be mounted on the Linux client and on Windows client and LUNS can be accessed on Linux or Windows clients as block devices when mounted over iSCSI because Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports iSCSI, SMB, and NFS protocols. Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes can be set up in a few simple steps.

To replicate volumes from an on-premises environment to the cloud for disaster recovery or migration purposes, establish network connectivity to Google Cloud, either using a site-to-site VPN or Cloud Interconnect. Replicating data from on-premises to Cloud Volumes ONTAP is outside the scope of this document. To replicate data between on-premises and Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, see link:mailto:CloudOwner@gve.local#setting-up-data-replication-between-systems[Setting up data replication between systems].

NOTE: Use link:https://cloud.netapp.com/cvo-sizer[Cloud Volumes ONTAP sizer] to accurately size the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances. Also monitor on-premises performance to use as inputs in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP sizer.
