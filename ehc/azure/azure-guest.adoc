== Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO)

Cloud volumes ONTAP, or CVO, is the industry-leading cloud data management solution built on NetApp’s ONTAP storage software, available natively on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

It is a software-defined version of ONTAP that consumes cloud-native storage, allowing you to have the same storage software in the cloud and on-premises, reducing the need to retrain you IT staff in all-new methods to manage your data.

CVO gives customers the ability to seamlessly move data from the edge, to the data center, to the cloud and back, bringing your hybrid cloud together — all managed with a single-pane management console, NetApp Cloud Manager.

By design, CVO delivers extreme performance and advanced data management capabilities to satisfy even your most demanding applications in the cloud

.Deploy new Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure
[%collapsible]
=====

Cloud Volumes ONTAP shares and LUNs can be mounted from VMs that are created in the Azure VMware Solution SDDC environment. The volumes can also be mounted on the Linux client and on Windows client because Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports iSCSI, SMB, and NFS protocols. Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes can be set up in a few simple steps.

To replicate volumes from an on-premises environment to the cloud for disaster recovery or migration purposes, establish network connectivity to Azure, either using a site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute. Replicating data from on-premises to Cloud Volumes ONTAP is outside the scope of this document. To replicate data between on-premises and Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_replicating_data.html#setting-up-data-replication-between-systems[Setting up data replication between systems].

NOTE: Use link:https://cloud.netapp.com/cvo-sizer[Cloud Volumes ONTAP sizer] to accurately size the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances. Also monitor on-premises performance to use as inputs in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP sizer.

. Log in to NetApp Cloud Central—the Fabric View screen is displayed. Locate the Cloud Volumes ONTAP tab and select Go to Cloud Manager. After you are logged in, the Canvas screen is displayed.
+
image:azure-cvo-guest-1.png[]

. On the Cloud Manager home page, click Add a Working Environment and then select Microsoft Azure as the cloud and the type of the system configuration.
+
image:azure-cvo-guest-2.png[]

. When creating the first Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, Cloud Manager prompts you to deploy a Connector.

.Additional configurations for SMB volumes
[%collapsible]
=====

. After the working environment is ready, make sure the CIFS server is configured with the appropriate DNS and Active Directory configuration parameters. This step is required before you can create the SMB volume.
+
image:azure-cvo-guest-20.png[]

. Creating the SMB volume is an easy process. Select the CVO instance to create the volume and click the Create Volume option. Choose the appropriate size and cloud manager chooses the containing aggregate or use advanced allocation mechanism to place on a specific aggregate. For this demo, SMB is selected as the protocol.
+
image:azure-cvo-guest-21.png[]

. After the volume is provisioned, it will be availabe under the Volumes pane. Because a CIFS share is provisioned, give your users or groups permission to the files and folders and verify that those users can access the share and create a file. This step is not required if the volume is replicated from an on-premises environment because the file and folder permissions are all retained as part of SnapMirror replication.
+
image:azure-cvo-guest-22.png[]

. After the volume is created, use the mount command to connect to the share from the VM running on the Azure VMware Solution SDDC hosts.

. Copy the following path and use the Map Network Drive option to mount the volume on the VM running on Azure VMware Solution SDDC.
