== Overview: Migrating virtual machines with VMware HCX, Azure NetApp Files datastores, and Azure VMware solution

One of the most common use cases for the Azure VMware Solution and Azure NetApp Files datastore is the migration of VMware workloads. VMware HCX is a preferred option and provides various migration mechanisms to move on-premises virtual machines (VMs) and its data to Azure NetApp Files datastores.

VMware HCX is primarily a migration platform that is designed to simplify application migration, workload rebalancing, and even business continuity across clouds. It is included as part of Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud and offers many ways to migrate workloads and can be used for disaster recovery (DR) operations.  

This document provides step-by-step guidance for provisioning Azure NetApp Files datastore followed by downloading, deploying, and configuring VMware HCX, including all its main components in on-premises and the Azure VMware Solution side including Interconnect, Network Extension, and WAN optimization for enabling various VM migration mechanisms.

[NOTE]
VMware HCX works with any datastore type as the migration is at the VM level. Hence this document is applicable to existing NetApp customers and non-NetApp customers who are planning to deploy Azure NetApp Files with Azure VMware Solution for a cost-effective VMware cloud deployment.

.Prerequisites
[%collapsible]
=====
Before you begin, make sure the following prerequisites are met. For more information, see this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/configure-vmware-hcx[link^]. After the prerequisites, including connectivity, are in place, configure and activate HCX by generating the license key from the Azure VMware Solution portal. After the OVA installer is downloaded, proceed with the installation process as described below.

[NOTE]
HCX advanced is the default option and VMware HCX Enterprise edition is also available through a support ticket and supported at no additional cost.

* Use an existing Azure VMware solution software-defined data center (SDDC) or create a private cloud by using this https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/ehc/azure/azure-setup.html[NetApp link^] or this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/deploy-azure-vmware-solution?tabs=azure-portal[Microsoft link^].
* Migration of VMs and associated data from the on-premises VMware vSphere- enabled data center requires network connectivity from the data center to the SDDC environment. Before migrating workloads, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/tutorial-expressroute-global-reach-private-cloud[set up a site-to-site VPN or Express route global reach connection^] between the on-premises environment and the respective private cloud.
* The network path from on-premises VMware vCenter Server environment to the Azure VMware Solution private cloud must support the migration of VMs by using vMotion.
* Make sure the required https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-user-guide/GUID-A631101E-8564-4173-8442-1D294B731CEB.html[firewall rules and ports^] are allowed for vMotion traffic between the on-premises vCenter Server and SDDC vCenter. On the private cloud, routing on the vMotion network is configured by default.
* Azure NetApp Files NFS volume should be mounted as a datastore in Azure VMware Solution.  Follow the steps detailed in this https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/attach-azure-netapp-files-to-azure-vmware-solution-hosts?tabs=azure-portal[link^] to attach Azure NetApp Files datastores to Azure VMware Solutions hosts.

.Step 5: Configure the network profile, compute profile, and service mesh
[%collapsible]
=====
The VMware HCX Interconnect service appliance provides replication and vMotion-based migration capabilities over the internet and private connections to the target site. The interconnect provides encryption, traffic engineering, and VM mobility. To create an Interconnect service appliance, complete the followings steps:

. Under Infrastructure, select *Interconnect > Multi-Site Service Mesh > Compute Profiles > Create Compute Profile*.

[NOTE]
The compute profiles define the deployment parameters including the appliances that are deployed and which portion of the VMware data center are accessible to HCX service.

image:anfd-hcx-image12.png[Screenshot of the vSphere client Interconnect page.]

. After the compute profile is created, create the network profiles by selecting *Multi-Site Service Mesh > Network Profiles > Create Network Profile*.

The network profile defines a range of IP address and networks that are used by HCX for its virtual appliances.

[NOTE]
This step requires two or more IP addresses. These IP addresses are assigned from the management network to the Interconnect Appliances.

image:anfd-hcx-image13.png[Screenshot of adding IP addresses to the vSphere client Interconnect page.]

. At this time, the compute and network profiles have been successfully created.
. Create the Service Mesh by selecting the *Service Mesh* tab within the *Interconnect* option and select the on-premises and Azure SDDC sites.
. The Service Mesh specifies a local and remote compute and network profile pair. 

[NOTE]
As part of this process, the HCX appliances are deployed and automatically configured on both the source and target sites in order to create a secure transport fabric.

image:anfd-hcx-image14.png[Screenshot of Service Mesh tab on the vSphere client Interconnect page.]

. This is the final step of configuration. This should take close to 30 minutes to complete the deployment. After the service mesh is configured, the environment is ready with the IPsec tunnels successfully created to migrate the workload VMs.

image:anfd-hcx-image15.png[Screenshot of the completed process on the vSphere client Interconnect page.]
=====

.Step 6: Migrate workloads
[%collapsible]
=====
Workloads can be migrated bidirectionally between on-premises and Azure SDDCs using various VMware HCX migration technologies. VMs can be moved to and from VMware HCX-activated entities using multiple migration technologies such as HCX bulk migration, HCX vMotion, HCX Cold migration, HCX Replication Assisted vMotion (available with HCX Enterprise edition), and HCX OS Assisted Migration (available with the HCX Enterprise edition).

To learn more about various HCX migration mechanisms, see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-user-guide/GUID-8A31731C-AA28-4714-9C23-D9E924DBB666.html[VMware HCX Migration Types^].

*Bulk migration*

This section details the bulk migration mechanism. During a bulk migration, the bulk migration capability of HCX uses vSphere Replication to migrate disk files while recreating the VM on the destination vSphere HCX instance.

To initiate bulk VM migrations, complete the following steps:

. Access the *Migrate* tab under *Services > Migration*. 

image:anfd-hcx-image16.png[Screenshot of the Migration section in the vSphere client.]

. Under *Remote Site Connection*, select the remote site connection and select the source and destination. In this example, the destination is Azure VMware Solution SDDC HCX endpoint.  
. Click *Select VMs for Migration*. This provides a list of all the on-premises VMs.  Select the VMs based on the match:value expression and click *Add*.
. In the *Transfer and Placement* section, update the mandatory fields (*Cluster*, *Storage*, *Destination*, and *Network*), including the migration profile, and click *Validate*.

image:anfd-hcx-image17.png[Screenshot of the Transfer and Placement section of the vSphere client.]

. After the validation checks are complete, click *Go* to initiate the migration.

image:anfd-hcx-image18.png[Screenshot of migration initiation.]

[NOTE]
During this migration, a placeholder disk is created on the specified Azure NetApp Files datastore within the target vCenter to enable replication of the source VM disk's data to the placeholder disks. HBR is triggered for a full sync to the target, and after the baseline is complete, an incremental sync is performed based on the recovery point objective (RPO) cycle. After the full/incremental sync is complete, switchover is triggered automatically unless a specific schedule is set.

. After the migration is complete, validate the same by accessing the destination SDDC vCenter.
