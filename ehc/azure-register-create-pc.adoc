. Sign in to the Azure portal.
. On the Azure portal menu, select All Services.
. In the All Services dialog box, enter the subscription and then select Subscriptions.
. To view, select the subscription from the subscription list.

. After the resource provider is registered, create an Azure VMware Solution private cloud by using the Azure portal.
. Sign in to the Azure portal.
. Select Create a New Resource.
. In the Search the Marketplace text box, enter Azure VMware Solution and select it from the results.
. On the Azure VMware Solution page, select Create.
. From the Basics tab, enter the values in the fields and select Review + Create.

Notes:

* For a quick start, gather the required information during the planning phase.

* Select an existing resource group or create a new resource group for the private cloud. A resource group is a logical container in which the Azure resources are deployed and managed.

* Make sure the CIDR address is unique and does not overlap with other Azure Virtual Networks or on-premises networks. The CIDR represents the private cloud management network and is used for the cluster management services, such as vCenter Server and NSX-T Manager. NetApp recommends using a /22 address space. In this example, 10.21.0.0/22 is used.

The provisioning process takes approximately 4â€“5 hours. After the process is complete, verify that the deployment was successful by accessing the private cloud from the Azure portal. A status of Succeeded is displayed when the deployment is complete.

An Azure VMware Solution private cloud requires an Azure Virtual Network. Because Azure VMware Solution doesn't support on-premises vCenter, additional steps are required to integrate with an existing on-premises environment. Setting up an ExpressRoute circuit and a virtual network gateway is also required. While waiting for the cluster provisioning to complete, create a new virtual network or use an existing one to connect to Azure VMware Solution.
