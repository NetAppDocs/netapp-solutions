[.lead]
A common use case for VMware Cloud (VMC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS),  with its supplemental NFS datastore on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP,  is the migration of VMware workloads. VMware HCX is a preferred option and provides various migration methods to move on-premises virtual machines (VMs) and their data,  running on any VMware supported datastores,  to VMC datastores,  which includes supplemental NFS datastores on FSx for ONTAP.

Author(s): NetApp Solutions Engineering

== Overview: Migrating virtual machines with VMware HCX, FSx ONTAP supplemental datastores, and VMware Cloud

VMware HCX is primarily a mobility platform that is designed to simplify workload migration, workload rebalancing,  and business continuity across clouds.  It is included as part of VMware Cloud on AWS and offers many ways to migrate workloads and can be used for disaster recovery (DR) operations.  

This document provides step-by-step guidance for deploying and configuring VMware HCX,  including all its main components,  on-premises and on the cloud data center side,  which enables various VM migration mechanisms.  

For more information, see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-getting-started/GUID-DE0AD0AE-A6A6-4769-96ED-4D200F739A68.html[Introduction to HCX Deployments^] and https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-getting-started/GUID-70F9C40C-804C-4FC8-9FBD-77F9B2FA77CA.html[Install Checklist B - HCX with a VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC Destination Environment^].

.Prerequisites
[%collapsible]
=====
Before you begin, make sure the following prerequisites are met. For more information, see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-user-guide/GUID-A631101E-8564-4173-8442-1D294B731CEB.html[Preparing for HCX Installation^].  After the prerequisites are in place, including connectivity,  configure and activate HCX by generating a license key from the VMware HCX Console at VMC. After HCX is activated, the vCenter Plug- in is deployed and can be accessed by using the vCenter Console for management.  

The following installation steps must be completed before proceeding with HCX activation and deployment:

. Use an existing VMC SDDC or create a new SDDC following this link:aws-setup.html[NetApp link^] or this https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/com.vmware.vmc-aws.getting-started/GUID-EF198D55-03E3-44D1-AC48-6E2ABA31FF02.html[VMware link^].

. The network path from the on-premises vCenter environment to the VMC SDDC must support migration of VMs by using vMotion. 

. Make sure the required https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-user-guide/GUID-A631101E-8564-4173-8442-1D294B731CEB.html[firewall rules and ports^] are allowed for vMotion traffic between the on-premises vCenter Server and the SDDC vCenter. 

. The FSx for ONTAP NFS volume should be mounted as a supplemental datastore in the VMC SDDC.  To attach the NFS datastores to the appropriate cluster, follow the steps outlined in this link:aws-native-overview.html[NetApp link^] or this https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/com.vmware.vmc-aws-operations/GUID-D55294A3-7C40-4AD8-80AA-B33A25769CCA.html[VMware link^].

.High Level Architecture
[%collapsible]
=====
For testing purposes, the on-premises lab environment used for this validation was connected through a site-to-site VPN to AWS VPC, which allowed on-premises connectivity to AWS and to VMware cloud SDDC through External transit gateway. HCX migration and network extension traffic flows over the internet between on-premises and VMware cloud destination SDDC.  This architecture can be modified to use Direct Connect private virtual interfaces.

The following image depicts the high-level architecture.

.Step 5: Configure the network profile, compute profile, and service mesh
[%collapsible]
=====
The VMware HCX Interconnect (HCX-IX) appliance provides secure tunnel capabilities over the internet and private connections to the target site that enable replication and vMotion-based capabilities. The interconnect provides encryption, traffic engineering, and an SD-WAN.  To create the HCI-IX Interconnect Appliance, complete the following steps:

. Under Infrastructure, select Interconnect > Multi-Site Service Mesh > Compute Profiles > Create Compute Profile.
+
[NOTE]
Compute profiles contain the compute, storage, and network deployment parameters required to deploy an interconnect virtual appliance. They also specify which portion of the VMware data center will be accessible to the HCX service.
+
For detailed instructions, see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-user-guide/GUID-BBAC979E-8899-45AD-9E01-98A132CE146E.html[Creating a Compute Profile^].
+
image::fsx-hcx-image13.png[]

. After the compute profile is created, create the network profile by selecting Multi-Site Service Mesh > Network Profiles > Create Network Profile.
. The network profile defines a range of IP address and networks that will be used by HCX for its virtual appliances.
+
[NOTE]
This will require two or more IP address. These IP addresses will be assigned from the management network to virtual appliances.
+
image::fsx-hcx-image14.png[]
+
For detailed instructions, see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-user-guide/GUID-184FCA54-D0CB-4931-B0E8-A81CD6120C52.html[Creating a Network Profile^].
+
[NOTE]
If you are connecting with an SD-WAN over the internet, you have to reserve public IPs under the Networking and Security section.

. To create a service mesh,  select the Service Mesh tab within the Interconnect option and select on-premises and VMC SDDC sites.
+
The service mesh establishes a local and remote compute and network profile pair. 
+
image::fsx-hcx-image15.png[]
+
[NOTE]
Part of this process involves deploying HCX appliances that will be automatically configured on both the source and target sites, creating a secure transport fabric.

. Select the source and remote compute profiles and click Continue.
+
image::fsx-hcx-image16.png[]

. Select the service to be activated and click Continue.

.Step 6: Migrating Workloads
[%collapsible]
=====
HCX provides bidirectional migration services between two or more distinct environments such as on-premises and VMC SDDCs. Application workloads can be migrated to and from HCX activated sites using a variety of migration technologies such as HCX bulk migration, HCX vMotion, HCX Cold migration, HCX Replication Assisted vMotion (available with HCX Enterprise edition),  and HCX OS Assisted Migration (available with HCX Enterprise edition).

To learn more about available HCX migration technologies, see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-user-guide/GUID-8A31731C-AA28-4714-9C23-D9E924DBB666.html[VMware HCX Migration Types^]

The HCX-IX appliance uses the Mobility Agent service to perform vMotion, Cold, and Replication Assisted vMotion (RAV) migrations.

[NOTE]
The HCX-IX appliance adds the Mobility Agent service as a host object in the vCenter Server. The processor, memory, storage and networking resources displayed on this object do not represent actual consumption on the physical hypervisor hosting the IX appliance.

image::fsx-hcx-image19.png[]

.VMware HCX vMotion
[%collapsible]
====== 
This section describes the HCX vMotion mechanism. This migration technology uses the VMware vMotion protocol to migrate a VM to VMC SDDC.  The vMotion migration option is used for migrating the VM state of a single VM at a time.  There is no service interruption during this migration method.  

[NOTE]
Network Extension should be in place (for the port group in which the VM is attached) in order to migrate the VM without the need to make an IP address change.

. From the on-premises vSphere client,  go to Inventory, right- click on the VM to be migrated,  and select HCX Actions > Migrate to HCX Target Site.
+
image::fsx-hcx-image20.png[]

. In the Migrate Virtual Machine wizard,  select the Remote Site Connection (target VMC SDDC). 
+
image::fsx-hcx-image21.png[]

. Add a group name and under Transfer and Placement, update the mandatory fields (Cluster, Storage, and Destination Network), Click Validate.
+
image::fsx-hcx-image22.png[]

. After the validation checks are complete, click Go to initiate the migration.
+
[NOTE]
The vMotion transfer captures the VM active memory, its execution state, its IP address, and its MAC address.  For more information about the requirements and limitations of HCX vMotion,  see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.1/hcx-user-guide/GUID-517866F6-AF06-4EFC-8FAE-DA067418D584.html[Understanding VMware HCX vMotion and Cold Migration^].

. You can monitor the progress and completion of the vMotion from the HCX > Migration dashboard.
+
image::fsx-hcx-image23.png[]
======

.VMware Replication Assisted vMotion
[%collapsible]
====== 
As you might have noticed from VMware documentation, VMware HCX Replication Assisted vMotion (RAV) combines the benefits of bulk migration and vMotion. Bulk migration uses vSphere Replication to migrate multiple VMs in parallel—the VM gets rebooted during switchover. HCX vMotion migrates with no downtime,  but it is performed serially one VM at a time in a replication group.  RAV replicates the VM in parallel and keeps it in sync until the switchover window.  During the switchover process, it migrates one VM at a time with no downtime for the VM.

The following screenshot show the migration profile as Replication Assisted vMotion.

image::fsx-hcx-image24.png[]

The duration of the replication might be longer compared to the vMotion of a small number of VMs.  With RAV, only sync the deltas and include the memory contents. The following is a screenshot of the migration status—it shows how the start time of the migration is the same and the end time is different for each VM.

image::fsx-hcx-image25.png[]
======

For additional information about the HCX migration options and on how to migrate workloads from on-premises to VMware Cloud on AWS using HCX, see the https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.4/hcx-user-guide/GUID-14D48C15-3D75-485B-850F-C5FCB96B5637.html[VMware HCX User Guide^].

[NOTE]
VMware HCX vMotion requires 100Mbps or higher throughput capability.

[NOTE]
The target VMC FSx for ONTAP datastore must have sufficient space to accommodate the migration.
