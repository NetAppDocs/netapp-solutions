== List all backups
You can list all Backup CRs by using the OC CLI tool or the Velero CLI tool.

== Deleting a backup

You can delete a Backup CR without deleting the Object Storage data by using the OC CLI tool. The backup will be removed from the CLI/Console output. However, since the corresponding backup is not removed from the object storage, it will re-appear in the CLI/console output.

**If you want to delete the Backup CR AND the associated object storage data, you can do so by using the Velero CLI tool.**
