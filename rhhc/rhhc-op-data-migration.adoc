This page shows the data migration options for container workloads on Red Hat OpenShift clusters with Trident Protect.

Kubernetes Applications are often required to be moved from one environment to another. To migrate an application along with its persistent data, NetApp Trident Protect can be utilized.

== Data Migration between different Kubernetes environment
ACC supports various Kubernetes flavors including Google Anthos, Red Hat OpenShift, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, Rancher Kubernetes Engine, Upstream Kubernetes, etc. For additional details, refer link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/get-started/requirements.html#supported-host-cluster-kubernetes-environments[here]. 

To migrate application from one cluster to another, you can use one of the following features of ACC:

- ** replication **
- ** backup and restore **
- ** clone **

Refer to the link:rhhc-op-data-protection.html[data protection section] for the **replication and backup and restore** options.
