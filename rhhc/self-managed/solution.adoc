Customers may be at a point in their modernization journey when they are ready to move some select workloads or all workloads from their data centers to the cloud. They may choose to use self-managed OpenShift containers and self-managed NetApp storage in the cloud for various reasons. They should plan and deploy the Red Hat OpenShift container platform (OCP) in the cloud for a successful production-ready environment for migrating their container workloads from their data centers. Their OCP clusters can be deployed on VMware or Bare Metal in their data centers and on AWS, Azure or Google Cloud in the cloud environment. 

NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage delivers data protection, reliability, and flexibility for container deployments in AWS, Azure and in Google Cloud. Astra Trident serves as the dynamic storage provisioner to consume the persistent Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage for customers' stateful applications. Astra Control Center can be used to orchestrate the many data management requirements of stateful applications such as data protection, migration, and business continuity.
