[.lead]
This page shows the data migration options for container workloads on Red Hat OpenShift clusters with Astra Control Center (ACC). Specifically, customers can use ACC to 
- move some selected workloads or all workloads from their on-premises data centers to the cloud
- clone their apps to the cloud either for testing purposes or move from the data center to the cloud

== Data Migration

To migrate application from one environment to another, you can use one of the following features of ACC:

- ** replication ** 
- ** backup and restore **
- ** clone **

Refer to the link:../data-protection[data protection section] for the **replication and backup and restore** options.
Refer link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/use/clone-apps.html[here] for additional details about **cloning**.

NOTE: Astra Replication feature is only supported with Trident Container Storage Interface (CSI). However, replication is not supported by nas-economy & san-economy drivers.
