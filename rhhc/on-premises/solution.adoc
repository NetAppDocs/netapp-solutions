If customers have a need to run their modern containerized applications on infrastructure in their private data centers, they can do so. They should plan and deploy the Red Hat OpenShift container platform (OCP) for a successful production-ready environment for deploying their container workloads. Their OCP clusters can be deployed on VMware or bare metal. 

NetApp ONTAP storage delivers data protection, reliability, and flexibility for container deployments. Astra Trident serves as the dynamic storage provisioner to consume persistent ONTAP storage for customersâ€™ stateful applications. Astra Control Center can be used to orchestrate the many data management requirements of stateful applications such as data protection, migration, and business continuity.

With VMware vSphere, NetApp ONTAP tools provides a vCenter Plugin which can be utilized to provision datastores. Apply tags and use it with OpenShift for storing the node configuration and data. NVMe based storage provides lower latency and high performance.

This solution provides details for data protection and migration of container workloads using Astra Control Center. For this solution, the container workloads are deployed on Red Hat OpenShift clusters on vSphere within the on-premises environment. 
NOTE: We will provide a solution for container workloads on OpenShift clusters on bare metal in the future.
