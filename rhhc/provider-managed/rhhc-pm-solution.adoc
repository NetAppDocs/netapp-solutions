Customers may be "born in the cloud" or may be at a point in their modernization journey when they are ready to move some select workloads or all workloads from their data centers to the cloud. They may choose to use provider-managed OpenShift containers and provider-managed NetApp storage in the cloud for running their workloads. They should plan and deploy the Managed Red Hat OpenShift container clusters (ROSA) in the cloud for a successful production-ready environment for their container workloads. When they are in AWS cloud, they could also deploy FSx for NetApp ONTAP for the storage needs.

FSx for NetApp ONTAP delivers data protection, reliability, and flexibility for container deployments in AWS. Astra Trident serves as the dynamic storage provisioner to consume the persistent FSxN storage for customers' stateful applications.

As ROSA can be deployed in HA mode with control plane nodes spread across multiple availability zones, FSx ONTAP can also be provisioned with Multi-AZ option which provides high availability and protect against AZ failures.

NOTE: There are no data transfer charges when accessing an Amazon FSx file system from the file system's preferred Availability Zone (AZ). For more info on pricing, refer link:https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/netapp-ontap/pricing/[here].
