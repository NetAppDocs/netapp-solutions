This page shows the data migration options for container workloads on Managed Red Hat OpenShift clusters using FSx for NetApp ONTAP for persistent storage. 

== Data Migration

Red Hat OpenShift service on AWS as well as FSx for NetApp ONTAP (FSxN) are part of their service portfolio by AWS. FSxN is available on Single AZ or Multi-AZ options.
Multi-Az option provides data protection from availability zone failure. 
FSxN can be integrated with Astra Trident to provide persistent storage for applications on ROSA clusters.

The migration of container applications involves:

- Persistent volumes: this can be accomplished using BlueXP. 
Another option is to use Astra Control Center to handle container application migrations from on-premises to the cloud environment. Automation can be used for the same purpose. 

- Application metadata: this can be accomplished using OpenShift GitOps (Argo CD).

=== Failover and Fail-back of applications on ROSA cluster using FSxN for persistent storage

The following video is a demonstration of application failover and fail-back scenarios using BlueXP and Argo CD.
