The solution tests and validates Migration & Centralized Data Protection with OpenShift container platform (OCP), OpenShift Advanced Cluster Manager (ACM), NetApp ONTAP, NetApp BlueXP and NetApp Astra Control Center (ACC).

For this solution, the following scenarios are tested and validated by NetApp. The solution is separated into multiple scenarios based on the following characteristics:

* on-premises
* cloud
** self-managed OpenShift clusters and self-managed NetApp storage
** provider-managed OpenShift clusters and provider-managed NetApp storage

**We will be building out additional solutions and use cases in the future.** 

== Scenario 1: Data protection and migration within the on-premises environment using ACC 
**On-premises: self-managed OpenShift clusters and self-managed NetApp storage** 

* Using ACC, create Snapshot copies, backups and restores for data protection.
* Using ACC, perform a SnapMirror replication of container applications.

== Scenario 2: Data protection and migration from the on-premises environment to AWS environment using ACC:  
**On-premises: Self-managed OpenShift cluster and self-managed storage**
**AWS Cloud: Self-managed OpenShift cluster and self-managed storage**

* Using ACC, perform backups and restores for data protection.
* Using ACC, perform a SnapMirror replication of container applications.

== Scenario 3: Data protection and migration from the on-premises environment to AWS environment:  
**On-premises: Self-managed OpenShift cluster and self-managed storage**
**AWS Cloud: Provider-managed OpenShift cluster (ROSA) and provider-managed storage (FSxN)** 
 
* Using BlueXP, perform replication of persistent volumes (FSxN).  
* Using OpenShift GitOps, recreate application metadata.
