Velero’s backup and restore capabilities make it a valuable tool for migrating your data between clusters. This section describes how to migrate apps(s) from one cluster to another by creating a backup of the app in Object storage from one cluster and then restoring the app from the same object storage to another cluster. .

.Backup from first cluster  
[%collapsible]

====

**Prerequisites on Cluster 1**

* Astra Trident must be installed on the cluster. 
* A trident backend and Storage class must be created.
* OADP operator must be installed on the cluster.
* The DataProtectionApplication should be configured.

Use the following spec to configure the DataProtectionApplication object.
....
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: 'false'
          profile: default
          region: us-east-1
          s3ForcePathStyle: 'true'
          s3Url: 'https://10.61.181.161'
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: ontap-s3-credentials
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: velero
          caCert: <base-64 encoded tls certificate>
          prefix: container-backup
        provider: aws
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
        - csi
        - openshift
        - aws
        - kubevirt
....

* Create an application on the  cluster and take a backup of this application.
As an example, install a postgres application.

* Use the following spec for the backup CR:
....
spec:
  csiSnapshotTimeout: 10m0s
  defaultVolumesToFsBackup: false
  includedNamespaces:
    - postgresql
  itemOperationTimeout: 4h0m0s
  snapshotMoveData: true
  storageLocation: velero-sample-1
  ttl: 720h0m0s
....

You can click on the **All instances** tab to see the different objects being created and moving through different phases to finally come to the backup **completed** phase.

A backup of the resources in the namespace postgresql will be stored in the Object Storage location (ONTAP S3) specified in the backupLocation in the OADP spec.

.Restore to a second cluster  
[%collapsible]

====

**Prerequisites on Cluster 2**

* Astra Trident must be installed on cluster 2.
* The postgresql app must NOT be already installed in the postgresql namespace.
* OADP operator must be installed on cluster 2, and the BackupStorage Location must be pointing to the same object storage location where the backup was stored from the first cluster.
* The Backup CR must be visible from the second cluster.

Restore the app on this cluster from the backup. Use the following yaml to create the Restore CR.

....
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
metadata:
  name: restore
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: backup
  restorePVs: true
....

When the restore is completed, you will see that the postgresql app is running on this cluster and is associated with the pvc and a corresponding pv. The state of the app is the same as when the backup was taken.
