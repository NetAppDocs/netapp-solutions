The following resources must be configured by a storage administrator:

. Log into the NetApp ONTAP cluster as admin.
. Navigate to Storage > Storage VMs and click Add. Create two SVMs, one for project-1 and the other for project-2, by providing the required details. Also create a vsadmin account to manage the SVM and its resources.

[start=3]
. Log into the Red Hat OpenShift cluster as the storage administrator.
.	Create the backend for project-1 and map it to the SVM dedicated to the project. NetApp recommends using the SVM's vsadmin account to connect the backend to SVM instead of using the ONTAP cluster administrator.
[source, console]
cat << EOF | tridentctl -n trident create backend -f
{
    "version": 1,
    "storageDriverName": "ontap-nas",
    "backendName": "nfs_project_1",
    "managementLIF": "172.21.224.210",
    "dataLIF": "10.61.181.224",
    "svm": "project-1-svm",
    "username": "vsadmin",
    "password": "NetApp123"
}
EOF

NOTE: We are using the ontap-nas driver for this example. Use the appropriate driver when creating the backend based on the use case.

NOTE: We assume that Trident is installed in the trident project.

[start=5]
.	Similarly create the Trident backend for project-2 and map it to the SVM dedicated to project-2.
.	Next, create the storage classes. Create the storage class for project-1 and configure it to use the storage pools from backend dedicated to project-1 by setting the storagePools parameter.
[source, console]
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: project-1-sc
provisioner: csi.trident.netapp.io
parameters:
  backendType: ontap-nas
  storagePools: "nfs_project_1:.*"
EOF

.	Likewise, create a storage class for project-2 and configure it to use the storage pools from backend dedicated to project-2.
.	Create a ResourceQuota to restrict resources in project-1 requesting storage from storageclasses dedicated to other projects.
[source, console]
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
kind: ResourceQuota
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: project-1-sc-rq
  namespace: project-1
spec:
  hard:
    project-2-sc.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/persistentvolumeclaims: 0
EOF

.	Similarly, create a ResourceQuota to restrict resources in project-2 requesting storage from storageclasses dedicated to other projects.
