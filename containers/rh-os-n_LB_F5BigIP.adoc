[.lead]
F5 BIG-IP is an Application Delivery Controller (ADC) that offers a broad set of advanced production-grade traffic management and security services like L4-L7 load balancing, SSL/TLS offload, DNS, firewall and many more. These services drastically increase the availability, security and performance of your applications.

F5 BIG-IP can be deployed and consumed in various ways, on dedicated hardware, in the cloud, or as a virtual appliance on-premises. Refer to the documentation here to explore and deploy F5 BIG-IP as per requirement.

For efficient integration of F5 BIG-IP services with Red Hat OpenShift, F5 offers the BIG-IP Container Ingress Service (CIS). CIS is installed as a controller pod that watches OpenShift API for certain Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and manages the F5 BIG-IP system configuration. F5 BIG-IP CIS can be configured to control service types LoadBalancers and Routes in OpenShift.

Further, for automatic IP address allocation to service the type LoadBalancer, you can utilize the F5 IPAM controller. The F5 IPAM controller is installed as a controller pod that watches OpenShift API for LoadBalancer services with an ipamLabel annotation to allocate the IP address from a preconfigured pool.

This page lists the installation and configuration instructions for F5 BIG-IP CIS and IPAM controller. As a  prerequisite, you must have an F5 BIG-IP system deployed and licensed. It must also be licensed for SDN services, which are included by default with the BIG-IP VE base license.

NOTE: F5 BIG-IP can be deployed in standalone or cluster mode. For the purpose of this validation, F5 BIG-IP was deployed in standalone mode, but, for production purposes, it is preferred to have a cluster of BIG-IPs to avoid a single point of failure.

NOTE: An F5 BIG-IP system can be deployed on dedicated hardware, in the cloud, or as a virtual appliance on-premises with versions greater than 12.x for it to be integrated with F5 CIS. For the purpose of this document, the F5 BIG-IP system was validated as a virtual appliance, for example using the BIG-IP VE edition.

== Installation

.	Install the F5 Application Services 3 extension to allow BIG-IP systems to accept configurations in JSON instead of imperative commands. Go to https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/releases[F5 AS3 GitHub repository^], and download the latest RPM file.

.	Log into F5 BIG-IP system, navigate to iApps > Package Management LX and click Import.

.	Click Choose File and select the downloaded AS3 RPM file, click OK, and then click Upload.
+
image:redhat_openshift_image109.jpg[iApps upload]

.	Confirm that the AS3 extension is installed successfully.
+
image:redhat_openshift_image110.jpg[AS3 install validation]

.	Next configure the resources required for communication between OpenShift and BIG-IP systems. First create a tunnel between OpenShift and the BIG-IP server by creating a VXLAN tunnel interface on the BIG-IP system for OpenShift SDN. Navigate to Network > Tunnels > Profiles, click Create, and set the Parent Profile to vxlan and the Flooding Type to Multicast. Enter a name for the profile and click Finished.
+
image:redhat_openshift_image111.jpg[Create VXLAN profile]

.	Navigate to Network > Tunnels > Tunnel List, click Create, and enter the name and local IP address for the tunnel. Select the tunnel profile that was created in the previous step and click Finished.
+
image:redhat_openshift_image112.jpg[Create VXLAN tunnel]

.	Log into the Red Hat OpenShift cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

.	Create a hostsubnet on OpenShift for the F5 BIG-IP server, which extends the subnet from the OpenShift cluster to the F5 BIG-IP server. Download the host subnet YAML definition.
+
[source, cli]
wget https://github.com/F5Networks/k8s-bigip-ctlr/blob/master/docs/config_examples/openshift/f5-kctlr-openshift-hostsubnet.yaml

.	Edit the host subnet file and add the BIG-IP VTEP (VXLAN tunnel) IP for the OpenShift SDN.
+
[source, cli]
apiVersion: v1
kind: HostSubnet
metadata:
  name: f5-server
  annotations:
    pod.network.openshift.io/fixed-vnid-host: "0"
    pod.network.openshift.io/assign-subnet: "true"
# provide a name for the node that will serve as BIG-IP's entry into the cluster
host: f5-server
# The hostIP address will be the BIG-IP interface address routable to the
# OpenShift Origin nodes.
# This address is the BIG-IP VTEP in the SDN's VXLAN.
hostIP: 10.63.172.239
+
NOTE: Change the hostIP and other details as applicable to your environment.

.	Create the HostSubnet resource.

+
NOTE: Red Hat OpenShift, by default, provides a way to expose the services via Routes for L7 load balancing. An inbuilt OpenShift router is responsible for advertising and handling traffic for these routes. However, you can also configure the F5 CIS to support the Routes through an external F5 BIG-IP system, which can run either as an auxiliary router or a replacement to the self-hosted OpenShift router. CIS creates a virtual server in the BIG-IP system that acts as a router for the OpenShift routes, and BIG-IP handles the advertisement and traffic routing. Refer to the documentation here for information on parameters to enable this feature. Note that these parameters are defined for OpenShift Deployment resource in the apps/v1 API. Therefore, when using these with the F5BigIpCtlr resource cis.f5.com/v1 API, replace the hyphens (-) with underscores (_) for the parameter names.

.	The arguments that are passed to the creation of CIS resources include `ipam: true` and `custom_resource_mode: true`. These parameters are required for enabling CIS integration with an IPAM controller. Verify that the CIS has enabled IPAM integration by creating the F5 IPAM resource.
