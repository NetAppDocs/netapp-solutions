Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) is an enterprise virtual data center platform that runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and uses the KVM hypervisor.

For more information about RHV, see the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/virtualization/enterprise-virtualization[Red Hat Virtualization website^].

RHV provides the following features:

* *Centralized management of VMs and hosts* The RHV manager runs as a physical or virtual machine (VM) in the deployment and provides a web-based GUI for the management of the solution from a central interface.

* *Self-hosted engine* To minimize hardware requirements, RHV allows RHV Manager (RHV-M) to be deployed as a VM on the same hosts that run guest VMs.

* *High availability* To avoid disruption in event of host failures, RHV allows VMs to be configured for high availability. The highly available VMs are controlled at the cluster level using resiliency policies.

* *High scalability* A single RHV cluster can have up to 200 hypervisor hosts enabling it to support requirements of massive VMs to host resource-greedy,  enterprise-class workloads.

* *Enhanced security* Inherited from RHV, Secure Virtualization (sVirt) and Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) technologies are employed by RHV for the purposes of elevated security and hardening for the hosts and VMs. The key advantage from these features is logical isolation of a VM and its associated resources.

== Network design

The Red Hat OpenShift on NetApp solution uses two data switches to provide primary data connectivity at 25Gbps. It also uses two additional management switches that provide connectivity at 1Gbps for in-band management of the storage nodes and out-of-band management for IPMI functionality. OCP uses the virtual machine logical network on RHV for cluster management. This section describes the arrangement and purpose of each virtual network segment used in the solution and outlines the prerequisites for deploying the solution.

=== VLAN requirements

Red Hat OpenShift on RHV is designed to logically separate network traffic for different purposes by using virtual local area networks (VLANs). This configuration can be scaled to meet customer demands or to provide further isolation for specific network services. The following table lists the VLANs that are required to implement the solution while validating the solution at NetApp.

=== Network infrastructure support resources

The following infrastructure should be in place prior to the deployment of the OpenShift Container Platform:

* At least one DNS server providing full host-name resolution that is accessible from the in-band management network and the VM network.

* At least one NTP server that is accessible from the in-band management network and the VM network.

* (Optional) Outbound internet connectivity for both the in-band management network and the VM network.

== Best practices for production deployments

This section lists several best practices that an organization should take into consideration before deploying this solution into production.

=== Deploy OpenShift to an RHV cluster of at least three nodes

The verified architecture described in this document presents the minimum hardware deployment suitable for HA operations by deploying two RHV-H hypervisor nodes and ensuring a fault tolerant configuration where both hosts can manage the hosted-engine and deployed VMs can migrate between the two hypervisors.

Because Red Hat OpenShift initially deploys with three master nodes, it is ensured in a two-node configuration that at least two masters will occupy the same node, which can lead to a possible outage for OpenShift if that specific node becomes unavailable. Therefore, it is a Red Hat best practice that at least three RHV-H hypervisor nodes be deployed as part of the solution so that the OpenShift masters can be distributed evenly and the solution receives an added degree of fault tolerance.

=== Configure virtual machine/host affinity

You can distribute the OpenShift masters across multiple hypervisor nodes by enabling VM/host affinity.

Affinity is a way to define rules for a set of VMs and/or hosts that determine whether the VMs run together on the same host or hosts in the group or on different hosts. It is applied to VMs by creating affinity groups that consist of VMs and/or hosts with a set of identical parameters and conditions. Depending on whether the VMs in an affinity group run on the same host or hosts in the group or separately on different hosts, the parameters of the affinity group can define either positive affinity or negative affinity.

The conditions defined for the parameters can be either hard enforcement or soft enforcement. Hard enforcement ensures that the VMs in an affinity group always follows the positive or negative affinity strictly without any regards to external conditions. Soft enforcement ensures that a higher preference is set for the VMs in an affinity group to follow the positive or negative affinity whenever feasible. In the two or three hypervisor configuration described in this document, soft affinity is the recommended setting. In larger clusters, hard affinity can correctly distribute OpenShift nodes.

To configure affinity groups, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4/html/virtual_machine_management_guide/sect-affinity_groups[Red Hat 6.11. Affinity Groups documentation^].

=== Use a custom install file for OpenShift deployment

IPI makes the deployment of OpenShift clusters easy through the interactive wizard discussed earlier in this document. However, it is possible that there are some default values that might need to be changed as a part of cluster deployment.

In these instances, you can run and task the wizard without immediately deploying a cluster. Rather, a configuration file is created from which the cluster can be deployed later. This is very useful if you want to change any IPI defaults or if you wants to deploy multiple identical clusters in your environment for other uses such as multitenancy.
