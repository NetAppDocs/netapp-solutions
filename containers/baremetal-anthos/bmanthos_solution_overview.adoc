== NetApp ONTAP on NetApp AFF/FAS

NetApp AFF is a robust all-flash storage platform that provides low-latency performance, integrated data protection, multiprotocol support, and nondisruptive operations. Powered by NetApp ONTAP data management software, NetApp AFF ensures nondisruptive operations, from maintenance to upgrades to complete replacement of your storage system.

NetApp ONTAP is a powerful storage-software tool with capabilities such as an intuitive GUI, REST APIs with automation integration, AI-informed predictive analytics and corrective action, nondisruptive hardware upgrades, and cross-storage import.

ONTAP provides the following features:

* A unified storage system with simultaneous data access and management of NFS, CIFS, iSCSI, FC, FCoE, and FC-NVMe protocols.
* Different deployment models include on-premises on all-flash, hybrid, and all-HDD hardware configurations; VM-based storage platforms on a supported hypervisor such as ONTAP Select; and in the cloud as Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* Increased data storage efficiency on ONTAP systems with support for automatic data tiering, inline data compression, deduplication, and compaction.
* Workload-based, QoS-controlled storage.
* Seamless integration with a public cloud for tiering and protection of data. ONTAP also provides robust data protection capabilities that sets it apart in any environment:

** *NetApp Snapshot copies.* A fast, point-in-time backup of data using a minimal amount of disk space with no additional performance overhead.
** *NetApp SnapMirror.* Mirrors the Snapshot copies of data from one storage system to another. ONTAP supports mirroring data to other physical platforms and cloud-native services as well.
** *NetApp SnapLock.*  Efficiently administration of non-rewritable data by writing it to special volumes that cannot be overwritten or erased for a designated period.
** *NetApp SnapVault.* Backs up data from multiple storage systems to a central Snapshot copy that serves as a backup to all designated systems.
** *NetApp SyncMirror.* Provides real-time, RAID-level mirroring of data to two different plexes of disks that are connected physically to the same controller.
** *NetApp SnapRestore.* Provides fast restoration of backed-up data on demand from Snapshot copies.
** *NetApp FlexClone.* Provides instantaneous provisioning of a fully readable and writeable copy of a NetApp volume based on a Snapshot copy. For more information about ONTAP, see the https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/index.jsp[ONTAP 9 Documentation Center^].

NetApp ONTAP is available on-premises, virtualized, or in the cloud.

== NetApp Astra Trident

NetApp Astra Trident is an open-source and fully supported storage orchestrator for containers and Kubernetes distributions, including Google Cloud Anthos. It works with the entire NetApp storage portfolio, including NetApp ONTAP software. Trident is fully CSI-compliant, and it accelerates the DevOps workflow by allowing you to provision and manage storage from your NetApp storage systems, without intervention from a storage administrator. Trident is deployed as an operator that communicates directly with the Kubernetes API endpoint to serve containers’ storage requests in the form of persistent volume claims (PVCs) by creating and managing volumes on the NetApp storage system.

Persistent volumes (PVs) are provisioned based on storage classes defined in the Kubernetes environment. They use storage backends created by a storage administrator (which can be customized based on project needs) and storage system models to allow for any number of advanced storage features, such as compression, specific disk types, or QoS levels that guarantee performance.

For more information about NetApp Astra Trident, see the https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable-v20.10/[Trident^] page.

Trident orchestrates storage from each system and service in the NetApp portfolio.

== Google Cloud’s Anthos

Google Cloud’s Anthos is a cloud-based Kubernetes data center solution that enables organizations to construct and manage modern hybrid-cloud infrastructures while adopting agile workflows focused on application development. Anthos on bare metal extends the capability of Anthos to run on-premises directly on physical servers without a hypervisor layer and interoperate with Anthos GKE clusters in Google Cloud.

Adopting containers, service mesh, and other transformational technologies enables organizations to experience consistent application development cycles and production-ready workloads in local and cloud-based environments.

Anthos provides the following features:

* *Anthos configuration management.* Automates the policy and security of hybrid Kubernetes deployments.
* *Anthos Service Mesh.* Enhances application observability, security, and control with an Istio-powered service mesh.
* *Google Cloud Marketplace for Kubernetes applications.* A catalog of curated container applications available for easy deployment.
* *Migrate for Anthos.* Automatic migration of physical services and VMs from on-premises to the cloud. Figure 3 depicts the Anthos solution and how a deployment in an on-premises data center interconnects with infrastructure in the cloud.

For more information about Anthos, see the https://cloud.google.com/anthos/[Anthos website^].

The following figure presents Google Cloud’s Anthos architecture.

=== Anthos on bare metal

Anthos on bare metal is an extension of GKE that is deployed in a customer’s private data center. An organization can deploy the same applications designed to run in containers in Google Cloud in Anthos clusters on-premises. Anthos on bare metal runs directly on physical servers with the user’s choice of underlying Linux operating system and provides customers with a full-fledged hybrid cloud environment with the capability to run at the core or edge of their data centers.

Anthos on bare metal offers the following benefits:

* *Hardware agnostic.* Customers can run Anthos on their choice of optimized hardware platform in their existing data centers.
* *Cost savings.* You can realize significant cost savings by using your own physical resources for application deployments instead of provisioning resources in the Google Cloud environment.
* *Develop then publish.* You can use on-premises deployments while applications are in development, which allows for the testing of applications in the privacy of your local data center before you make them publicly available in the cloud.
* *Better performance.* Intensive applications that demand low latency and the highest levels of performance can be run closer to the hardware.
* *Security requirements.* Customers with increased security concerns or sensitive data sets that cannot be stored in the public cloud are able to run their applications from the security of their own data centers, thereby meeting organizational requirements.
* *Management and operations.* Anthos on bare metal comes with a wide range of facilities that increase operational efficiency such as built-in networking, lifecycle management, diagnostics, health checks, logging, and monitoring.
