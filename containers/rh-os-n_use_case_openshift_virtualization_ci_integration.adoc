To start collecting data for VMs in OpenShift Virtualization you will need to install:

. A Kubernetes monitoring operator and data collector to collect Kubernetes data
For complete instructions, refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_config_telegraf_agent_k8s.html[documentation].

. An acquisition unit to collect data from ONTAP storage that provides persistent storage for the VM disks
For complete instructions, refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_getting_started_with_cloud_insights.html[documentation].

. A data collector for ONTAP
For complete instructions, refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_getting_started_with_cloud_insights.html#configure-the-data-collector-infrastructure[documentation]

Additionally, if you are using StorageGrid for VM backups, you need a data collector for the StorageGRID as well.
