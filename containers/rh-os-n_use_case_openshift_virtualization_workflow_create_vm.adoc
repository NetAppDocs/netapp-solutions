== Create VM

VMs are stateful deployments and they require volumes to host the operating system and data. With CNV, since the VMs are run as pods, the VMs are backed by PVs hosted on NetApp ONTAP through Trident. These volumes are attached as disks and store the entire filesystem including the boot source of the VM.

To create a virtual machine on the OpenShift cluster, follow the below steps:

.	Navigate to Workloads -> Virtualization -> Virtual Machines and click on ‘Create’ -> ‘With Wizard’.
.	Select the desired the operating system and click ‘Next’.
.	If the selected operating system has no boot source configured, you must configure it. For Boot Source, select whether you want to import the OS image from an URL or from a registry, and provide the corresponding details. Expand ‘Advanced’ and select the Trident backed StorageClass. Then click ‘Next’.

.	If the selected operating system already has a boot source configured, the previous step can be skipped.
.	In the Review and Create pane, select the project you want to create the VM in and furnish the VM details. Ensure that the boot source is selected to be ‘Clone and boot from CD-ROM’ with the appropriate PVC assigned for the selected OS.

.	If you wish to customize the virtual machine, click on ‘Customize virtual machine’ and modify the required parameters.
.	Click on ‘Create virtual machine’ to create the virtual machine, this spins up a corresponding pod in the background.

When a boot source is configured for a template or an operating system from an URL or from a registry, it creates a PVC in ‘openshift-virtualization-os-images’ project and downloads the KVM guest image to the PVC. You must ensure that template PVCs  have enough provisioned space to accommodate the KVM guest image for the corresponding OS. These PVCs are then cloned and attached as rootdisks to virtual machines when they are created using the respective templates in any project.
