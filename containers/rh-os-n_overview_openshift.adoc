The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform unites development and IT operations on a single platform to build, deploy, and manage applications consistently across on-premises and hybrid cloud infrastructures. Red Hat OpenShift is built on open-source innovation and industry standards, including Kubernetes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS, the world’s leading enterprise Linux distribution designed for container-based workloads. OpenShift is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Certified Kubernetes program, providing portability and interoperability of container workloads.

== Red Hat OpenShift provides the following capabilities:

*  *Self-service provisioning.* Developers can quickly and easily create applications on demand from the tools that they use most, while operations retain full control over the entire environment.

* *Persistent storage.* By providing support for persistent storage, OpenShift Container Platform allows you to run both stateful applications and cloud-native stateless applications.

* *Continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD).* This source-code platform manages build and deployment images at scale.

* *Open-source standards.* These standards incorporate the Open Container Initiative (OCI) and Kubernetes for container orchestration, in addition to other open-source technologies. You are not restricted to the technology or to the business roadmap of a specific vendor.

* *CI/CD pipelines.* OpenShift provides out-of-the-box support for CI/CD pipelines so that development teams can automate every step of the application delivery process and make sure it’s executed on every change that is made to the code or configuration of the application.

* *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).* This feature provides team and user tracking to help organize a large developer group.

* *Automated build and deploy.* OpenShift gives developers the option to build their containerized applications or have the platform build the containers from the application source code or even the binaries. The platform then automates deployment of these applications across the infrastructure based on the characteristic that was defined for the applications. For example, how quantity of resources that should be allocated and where on the infrastructure they should be deployed in order for them to be compliant with third-party licenses.

* *Consistent environments.* OpenShift makes sure that the environment provisioned for developers and across the lifecycle of the application is consistent from the operating system, to libraries, runtime version (for example, Java runtime), and even the application runtime in use (for example, tomcat) in order to remove the risks originated from inconsistent environments.

* *Configuration management.* Configuration and sensitive data management is built in to the platform to make sure that a consistent and environment agnostic application configuration is provided to the application no matter which technologies are used to build the application or which environment it is
deployed.

* *Application logs and metrics.* Rapid feedback is an important aspect of application development. OpenShift integrated monitoring and log management provides immediate metrics back to developers in order for them to study how the application is behaving across changes and be able to fix issues as early as possible in the application lifecycle.

* *Security and container catalog.* OpenShift offers multitenancy and protects the user from harmful code execution by using established security with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), CGroups, and Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) to isolate and protect containers. It also provides encryption through TLS certificates for the various subsystems and access to Red Hat certified containers (access.redhat.com/containers) that are scanned and graded with a specific emphasis on security to provide certified, trusted, and secure application containers to end users.

== Deployment methods for Red Hat OpenShift

Starting with Red Hat OpenShift 4, the deployment methods for OpenShift include manual deployments using User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI) for highly customized deployments or fully automated deployments using Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI).

The IPI installation method is the preferred method in most cases because it allows for the rapid deployment of OpenShift clusters for dev, test, and production environments.

=== IPI installation of Red Hat OpenShift

The Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) deployment of OpenShift involves these high-level steps:

. Visit the Red Hat OpenShift https://www.openshift.com[website^] and login with your SSO credentials.

. Select the environment that you would like to deploy Red Hat OpenShift into.

. On the next screen download the installer, the unique pull secret, and the CLI tools for management.

. Follow the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/index.html[installation instructions] provided by Red Hat to deploy to your environment of choice.

=== NetApp validated OpenShift deployments

NetApp has tested and validated the deployment of Red Hat OpenShift in its labs using the Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) deployment method in each of the following data center environments:
