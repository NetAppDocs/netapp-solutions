This document will outline how to use NetApp ONTAP with the Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

== Create Volume Snapshot
**1. Create a Snapshot of the app volume**
In this section, we will show how to create a trident snapshot of the volume associated with the app.This will be a point in time copy of the app data. If the application data is lost, we can recover the data from this point in time copy. 
NOTE: This snapshot is stored in the same aggregate as the original volume in ONTAP(on-premises or in the cloud). So if the ONTAP storage aggregate is lost, we cannot recover the app data from its snapshot. 

**a. Create a VolumeSnapshotClass
Save the following manifest in a file called volume-snapshot-class.yaml
[source]
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
 name: fsx-snapclass
driver: csi.trident.netapp.io
deletionPolicy: Delete

Create a snapshot by using the above manifest.

**b. Next, create a snapshot**
Create a snapshot of the existing PVC by creating VolumeSnapshot to take a point-in-time copy of your Postgresql data. This creates an FSx snapshot that takes almost no space in the filesystem backend. Save the following manifest in a file called volume-snapshot.yaml:
[source]
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
 name: postgresql-volume-snap-01
spec:
 volumeSnapshotClassName: fsx-snapclass
 source:
   persistentVolumeClaimName: data-postgresql-0

**c. Create the volume snapshot and confirm that it is created**

Delete the database to simulate the loss of data (data loss can happen due to a variety of reasons, here we are just simulating it by deleting the database)

**d. Delete the database to simulate the loss of data (data loss can happen due to a variety of reasons, here we are just simulating it by deleting the database)**

== Restore from Volume Snapshot
**1. Restore from Snapshot**
In this section, we will show how to restore an application from the trident snapshot of the app volume.

**a. Create a volume clone from the snapshot**

To restore the volume to its previous state, you must create a new PVC based on the data in the snapshot you took. To do this, save the following manifest in a file named pvc-clone.yaml

[source]
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: postgresql-volume-clone
spec:
 accessModes:
   - ReadWriteOnce
 storageClassName: trident-csi
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 8Gi
 dataSource:
   name: postgresql-volume-snap-01
   kind: VolumeSnapshot
   apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io

Create a clone of the volume by creating a PVC using the snapshot as the source using the above manifest. Apply the manifest and ensure that the clone is created.

**b. Delete the original postgresql installation**

image:redhat_openshift_container_rosa_image25.png[postgresql app delete]

**c. Create a new postgresql application using the new clone PVC**
[source]
$ helm install postgresql bitnami/postgresql --set primary.persistence.enabled=true --set primary.persistence.existingClaim=postgresql-volume-clone -n postgresql

**d. Verify that the application pod is in the running state**

**e. Verify that the pod uses the clone as its PVC**

image:redhat_openshift_container_rosa_image28.png[postgresql new install describe]

f)	To validate that the database has been restored as expected, go back to the container console and show the existing databases
