This section provides the steps to deploy a continuous integration/continuous delivery or deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with Jenkins to validate solution operation.

== Create the resources required for Jenkins deployment

To create the resources required for deploying the Jenkins application, complete the following steps:

. Create a new project named Jenkins.

. In this example, we deployed Jenkins with persistent storage. To support the Jenkins build, create the PVC. Navigate to Storage > Persistent Volume Claims and click Create Persistent Volume Claim. Select the storage class that was created, make sure that the Persistent Volume Claim Name is jenkins, select the appropriate size and access mode, and then click Create.

. By default, the details for the Jenkins application are populated. Based on your requirements, modify the parameters and click Create. This process creates all the required resources for supporting Jenkins on OpenShift.

. The Jenkins pods take approximately 10 to 12 minutes to enter the Ready state.

. The Jenkins welcome page is displayed. Because we are using a Maven build, complete the Maven installation first. Navigate to Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration, and then, in the Maven subhead, click Add Maven. Enter the name of your choice and make sure that the Install Automatically option is selected. Click Save.

. Whenever there are any code changes, the pipeline can be rebuilt to patch the new version of software enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery. Click Recent Changes to track the changes from the previous version.
