Astra Trident is an open-source and fully supported storage orchestrator for containers and Kubernetes distributions, including Red Hat OpenShift. Trident works with the entire NetApp storage portfolio, including the NetApp ONTAP and Element storage systems, and it also supports NFS and iSCSI connections. Trident  accelerates the DevOps workflow by allowing end users to provision and manage storage from their NetApp storage systems without requiring intervention from a storage administrator.

An administrator can configure a number of storage backends based on project needs and storage system models that enable advanced storage features, including compression, specific disk types, or QoS levels that guarantee a certain level of performance. After they are defined, these backends can be used by developers in their projects to create persistent volume claims (PVCs) and to attach persistent storage to their containers on demand.

Astra Trident has a rapid development cycle, and just like Kubernetes, is released four times a year.

The latest version of Astra Trident is 22.01 released in January 2022. A support matrix for what version of Trident has been tested with which Kubernetes distribution can be found https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/requirements.html#supported-frontends-orchestrators[here].

Starting with the 20.04 release, Trident setup is performed by the Trident operator. The operator makes large scale deployments easier and provides additional support including self healing for pods that are deployed as a part of the Trident install.

With the 21.01 release, a Helm chart was made available to ease the installation of the Trident Operator.

== Install the Trident Operator with Helm

. First set the location of the user cluster’s `kubeconfig` file as an environment variable so that you don’t have to reference it, because Trident has no option to pass this file.

----

. Run the Helm command to install the Trident operator from the tarball in the helm directory while creating the trident namespace in your user cluster.

----
[netapp-user@rhel7 trident-installer]$ helm install trident helm/trident-operator-22.01.0.tgz --create-namespace --namespace trident
NAME: trident
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri May  7 12:54:25 2021
NAMESPACE: trident
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Thank you for installing trident-operator, which will deploy and manage NetApp's Trident CSI
storage provisioner for Kubernetes.

Your release is named 'trident' and is installed into the 'trident' namespace.
Please note that there must be only one instance of Trident (and trident-operator) in a Kubernetes cluster.

To configure Trident to manage storage resources, you will need a copy of tridentctl, which is
available in pre-packaged Trident releases.  You may find all Trident releases and source code
online at https://github.com/NetApp/trident.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status trident
  $ helm get all trident
----

. You can verify that Trident is successfully installed by checking the pods that are running in the namespace or by using the tridentctl binary to check the installed version.
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 trident-installer]$ oc get pods -n trident

NOTE: In some cases, customer environments might require the customization of the Trident deployment. In these cases, it is also possible to manually install the Trident operator and update the included manifests to customize the deployment.

== Manually install the Trident Operator

. First, set the location of the user cluster’s `kubeconfig` file as an environment variable so that you don’t have to reference it, because Trident has no option to pass this file.
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 trident-installer]$ export KUBECONFIG=~/ocp-install/auth/kubeconfig
----

. The `trident-installer` directory contains manifests for defining all the required resources. Using the appropriate manifests, create the `TridentOrchestrator` custom resource definition.
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 trident-installer]$ oc create -f deploy/crds/trident.netapp.io_tridentorchestrators_crd_post1.16.yaml
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/tridentorchestrators.trident.netapp.io created
----

. If one does not exist, create a Trident namespace in your cluster using the provided manifest.
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 trident-installer]$ oc apply -f deploy/namespace.yaml
namespace/trident created
----

. Create the resources required for the Trident operator deployment, such as a `ServiceAccount` for the operator, a `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` to the `ServiceAccount`, a dedicated `PodSecurityPolicy`, or the operator itself.
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 trident-installer]$ oc create -f deploy/bundle.yaml
serviceaccount/trident-operator created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/trident-operator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/trident-operator created
deployment.apps/trident-operator created
podsecuritypolicy.policy/tridentoperatorpods created
----

. You can check the status of the operator after it’s deployed with the following commands:
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 trident-installer]$ oc get deployment -n trident
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
trident-operator   1/1     1            1           23s
[netapp-user@rhel7 trident-installer]$ oc get pods -n trident

trident-operator-66f48895cc-lzczk   1/1     Running   0          41s
----

. With the operator deployed, we can now use it to install Trident. This requires creating a `TridentOrchestrator`.

== Prepare worker nodes for storage

=== NFS
Most Kubernetes distributions come with the packages and utilities to mount NFS backends installed by default, including Red Hat OpenShift.

However, for NFSv3, there is no mechanism to negotiate concurrency between the client and the server. Hence the maximum number of client-side sunrpc slot table entries must be manually synced with supported value on the server to ensure the best performance for the NFS connection without the server having to decrease the window size of the connection.

For ONTAP, the supported maximum number of sunrpc slot table entries is 128 i.e. ONTAP can serve 128 concurrent NFS requests at a time. However, by default, Red Hat CoreOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux has maximum of 65,536 sunrpc slot table entries per connection. We need to set this value to 128 and this can be done using Machine Config Operator (MCO) in OpenShift.

To modify the maximum sunrpc slot table entries in OpenShift worker nodes, complete the following steps:

. Log into the OCP web console and navigate to Compute > Machine Configs. Click Create Machine Config. Copy and paste the YAML file and click Create.
+
[source, cli]
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: 98-worker-nfs-rpc-slot-tables
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0

          filesystem: root
          mode: 420
          path: /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf

. After the MCO is created, the configuration needs to be applied on all worker nodes and rebooted one by one. The whole process takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Verify whether the machine config is applied by using `oc get mcp` and make sure that the machine config pool for workers is updated.
+

----

=== iSCSI
To prepare worker nodes to allow for the mapping of block storage volumes through the iSCSI protocol, you must install the necessary packages to support that functionality.

In Red Hat OpenShift, this is handled by applying an MCO (Machine Config Operator) to your cluster after it is deployed.

To configure the worker nodes to run iSCSI services, complete the following steps:

. Log into the OCP web console and navigate to Compute > Machine Configs. Click Create Machine Config. Copy and paste the YAML file and click Create.

. After the configuration is created, it takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes to apply the configuration to the worker nodes and reload them. Verify whether the machine config is applied by using `oc get mcp` and make sure that the machine config pool for workers is updated. You can also log into the worker nodes to confirm that the iscsid service is running (and the multipathd service is running if using multipathing).

== Create storage-system backends

After completing the Astra Trident Operator install, you must configure the backend for the specific NetApp storage platform you are using. Follow the links below in order to continue the setup and configuration of Astra Trident.
