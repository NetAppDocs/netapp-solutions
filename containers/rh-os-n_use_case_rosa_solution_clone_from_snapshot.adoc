In this section, we will show how to utilize FSx for ONTAP as a persistent storage layer for applications running on ROSA. It will show the installation of the NetApp Trident CSI driver on a ROSA cluster, the provisioning of an FSx for ONTAP file system, and the deployment of a sample stateful application. It will also show strategies for backing up and restoring your application data. With this integrated solution, you can establish a shared storage framework that effortlessly scales across AZs, simplifying the processes of scaling, protecting, and restoring your data using the Trident CSI driver.
