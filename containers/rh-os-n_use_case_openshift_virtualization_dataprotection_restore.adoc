== Prerequisites

To restore from a backup, let us assume that the namespace where the virtual machine existed got accidently deleted.

== Steps to perform a Restore
To restore from the backup that we just took, we need to create a Restore CR. 
We need to provide it a name, provide the name of the backup that we want to restore from and set the restorePVs to true. 
Additional parameters can be set as shown in the documentation. Click on Create button.

....
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore1
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: backup1
  restorePVs: true
....

When the phase shows completed, you will that the virtual machines have been restored 
to the state when the snapshot was taken.
