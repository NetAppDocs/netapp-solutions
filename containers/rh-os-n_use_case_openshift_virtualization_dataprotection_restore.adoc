= Restore a VM from a backup

== Prerequisites

To restore from a backup, let us assume that the namespace where the virtual machine existed got accidentally deleted.

== Steps to perform a Restore
To restore from the backup that we just created, we need to create a Restore Custom Resource (CR). We need to provide it a name, provide the name of the backup that we want to restore from and set the restorePVs to true. 
Additional parameters can be set as shown in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.html[documentation]. Click on Create button.

....
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore1
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: backup1
  restorePVs: true
....

When the phase shows completed, you will see that the virtual machines have been restored 
to the state when the snapshot was taken. (If the backup was created when the VM was running, restoring the VM from the backup will start the restored VM and bring it to a running state)
