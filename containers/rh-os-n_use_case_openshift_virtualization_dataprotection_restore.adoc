= Restore a VM from a backup

== Prerequisites

To restore from a backup, let us assume that the namespace where the virtual machine existed got accidentally deleted.

== Restore to the same namespace  
To restore from the backup that we just created, we need to create a Restore Custom Resource (CR). We need to provide it a name, provide the name of the backup that we want to restore from and set the restorePVs to true. Additional parameters can be set as shown in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.html[documentation]. Click on Create button.

....
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore1
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: backup1
  restorePVs: true
....

When the phase shows completed, you can see that the virtual machines have been restored to the state when the snapshot was taken. (If the backup was created when the VM was running, restoring the VM from the backup will start the restored VM and bring it to a running state). The VM is restored to the same namespace.

== Restore to a different namespace  

To restore the VM to a different namespace, you can provide a namespaceMapping in the yaml definition of the Restore CR.

The following sample yaml file creates a Restore CR to restore a VM and its disks in the virtual-machines-demo namespace when the backup was taken to the virtual-machines namespace.

....
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-to-different-ns
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: backup
  restorePVs: true 
  includedNamespaces:
  - virtual-machines-demo
  namespaceMapping:
    virtual-machines-demo: virtual-machines
....

When the phase shows completed, you can see that the virtual machines have been restored to the state when the snapshot was taken. (If the backup was created when the VM was running, restoring the VM from the backup will start the restored VM and bring it to a running state). The VM is restored to a different namespace as specified in the yaml.
