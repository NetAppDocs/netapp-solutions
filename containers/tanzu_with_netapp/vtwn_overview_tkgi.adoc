VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) Edition, formerly known as VMware Enterprise PKS, is a standalone container orchestration platform based on Kubernetes with capabilities like life cycle management, cluster health monitoring advanced networking, a container registry, etc. embedded into it as a package. TKGI provisions and manages Kubernetes clusters via the TKGI control plane consisting of BOSH and Ops Manager.

TKGI can be installed and operated either on vSphere or OpenStack environments on-premises or in any of the major public clouds on their respective IaaS offerings. Furthermore, the integration of TKGI with NSX-T and Harbour enables wider use-cases for enterprise workloads. To know more about TKGI and its capabilities, visit the documentation link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/index.html[here^].

TKGI is installed in a variety of configurations on a variety of platforms based on different use-cases and designs. Follow the guide link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/1.14/tkgi/GUID-index.html[here^] to install and configure TKGI and its prerequisites. TKGI uses Bosh VMs as nodes for Tanzu Kubernetes clusters which run immutable configuration images and thus any manual changes on Bosh VMs do not remain persistent across reboots. 

[NOTE]
====
Points to Note:

.	NetApp Trident requires privileged container access. So, while installing TKGI, in the step to configure Tanzu Kubernetes cluster worker node plans, ensure to tick the checkbox ‘Enable Privileged Containers’.

.	NetApp suggests that all the production environments be deployed in multiple master deployments for fault tolerance with the choice of worker nodes' configuration to meet the requirements of the intended workloads. Thus,  a suggested TKGI plan would consist of at least 3 masters and 3 workers with at least 4 vCPUs and 12GB of RAM for a highly intensive workload.
