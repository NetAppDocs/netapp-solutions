VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) Edition, formerly known as VMware Enterprise PKS, is a standalone container orchestration platform based on Kubernetes with capabilities like life cycle management, cluster health monitoring advanced networking, a container registry, etc. embedded into it as a package. TKGI provisions and manages Kubernetes clusters via the TKGI control plane consisting of BOSH and Ops Manager.

TKGI can be installed and operated either on vSphere or OpenStack environments on-premises or in any of the major public clouds on their respective IaaS offerings. Furthermore, the integration of TKGI with NSX-T and Harbour enables wider use-cases for enterprise workloads. To know more about TKGI and its capabilities, visit the documentation link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/index.html[here^].

.	The deployment of NetApp Astra Control Center requires at least 3 worker nodes with at least 4 vCPUs and 12GB RAM each. So, in the process of installing TKGI, while configuring Tanzu Kubernetes cluster worker node plans, ensure to configure a plan with at least the required resources as mentioned above.
