To enable the Astra Control Center to manage your workloads, you must first register your Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

== Register VMware Tanzu Kubernetes clusters

.	The first step is to add the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters to the Astra Control Center and manage them. Go to Clusters and click Add a Cluster, upload the kubeconfig file for the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster, and click Select Storage.

. Astra Control Center detects the eligible storage classes. Now select the way that storageclass provisions volumes using Trident backed by an SVM on NetApp ONTAP and click Review. In the next pane, verify the details and click Add Cluster.

.	When the cluster is added, it moves to the Discovering status while Astra Control Center inspects them and installs the necessary agents. Cluster status changes to `Healthy` after they are successfully registered.

NOTE: All Tanzu Kubernetes clusters to be managed by Astra Control Center should have access to the image registry that was used for its installation as the agents installed on the managed clusters pull the images from that registry.

.	Import ONTAP clusters as storage resources to be managed as backends by Astra Control Center. When Tanzu Kubernetes clusters are added to Astra and a storageclass is configured, it automatically discovers and inspects the ONTAP cluster backing the storageclass but does not import it into the Astra Control Center to be managed.

.	To import the ONTAP clusters, navigate to Backends, click the dropdown, and select Manage next to the ONTAP cluster to be managed. Enter the ONTAP cluster credentials, click Review Information, and then click Import Storage Backend.

. After the backends are added, the status changes to Available. These backends now have the information about the persistent volumes in the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster and the corresponding volumes on the ONTAP system.

.	For backup and restore across Tanzu Kubernetes clusters using Astra Control Center, you must provision an object storage bucket that supports the S3 protocol. Currently supported options are ONTAP S3, StorageGRID, AWS S3, and Microsoft Azure Blob storage. For the purpose of this installation, we are going to configure an AWS S3 bucket. Go to Buckets, click Add bucket, and select Generic S3. Enter the details about the S3 bucket and credentials to access it, click the checkbox "Make this bucket the default bucket for the cloud", and then click Add.
