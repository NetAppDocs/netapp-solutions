== Astra Control Center automation

Astra Control Center has a fully functional REST API for programmatic access. Users can use any programming language or utility to interact with Astra Control REST API endpoints. To learn more about this API, see the documentation link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[here^].

If you are looking for a ready-made software development toolkit for interacting with Astra Control REST APIs, NetApp provides a toolkit with Astra Control Python SDK, which you can download link:https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-astra-toolkits/[here^].

If programming is not apropriate for your situation and you would like to use a configuration management tool, you can clone and run the Ansible playbooks that NetApp publishes link:https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_astra_control_suite[here^].

== Astra Control Center installation prerequisites

.	One or more Tanzu Kubernetes clusters, managed either by a management cluster or TKGS or TKGI. It supports TKG workload clusters 1.4+ and TKGI user clusters 1.12.2+.

.	Astra Trident must already be installed and configured on each of the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

.	One or more NetApp ONTAP storage systems running ONTAP 9.5 or greater.
+
NOTE: It's best practice for each Tanzu Kubernetes install at a site to have a dedicated SVM for persistent storage. Multi-site deployments require additional storage systems.

.	A Trident storage backend must be configured on each Tanzu Kubernetes cluster with an SVM backed by an ONTAP cluster.

.	A default StorageClass configured on each Tanzu Kubernetes cluster with Astra Trident as the storage provisioner.

.	A load balancer must be installed and configured on each Tanzu Kubernetes cluster for load balancing and exposing Astra Control Center if you are using ingressType `AccTraefik`.

. An ingress controller must be installed and configured on each Tanzu Kubernetes cluster for exposing Astra Control Center if you are using ingressType `Generic`.

.	A private image registry must be configured to host the NetApp Astra Control Center images.

.	You must have Cluster Admin access to the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster where Astra Control Center is being installed.

.	You must have Admin access to NetApp ONTAP clusters.

.	A RHEL or Ubuntu admin workstation

=== Post Install Steps

.	It might take several minutes for the installation to complete. Verify that all the pods and services in the `netapp-astra-cc` namespace are up and running.
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 ~]$ kubectl get all -n netapp-astra-cc
----

. Check the `acc-operator-controller-manager` logs to ensure that the installation is completed.
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 ~]$ kubectl logs deploy/acc-operator-controller-manager -n netapp-acc-operator -c manager -f
----
+

NOTE: The following message indicates the successful installation of Astra Control Center.

+
----
{"level":"info","ts":1624054318.029971,"logger":"controllers.AstraControlCenter","msg":"Successfully Reconciled AstraControlCenter in [seconds]s","AstraControlCenter":"netapp-astra-cc/astra","ae.Version":"[22.04.0]"}
----
+
.	The username for logging into Astra Control Center is the email address of the administrator provided in the CRD file and the password is a string `ACC-` appended to the Astra Control Center UUID. Run the following command:
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 ~]$ oc get astracontrolcenters -n netapp-astra-cc
NAME    UUID
astra   345c55a5-bf2e-21f0-84b8-b6f2bce5e95f
----
+

NOTE: In this example, the password is `ACC-345c55a5-bf2e-21f0-84b8-b6f2bce5e95f`.

. Get the traefik service load balancer IP if the ingressType is AccTraefik.
+
----
[netapp-user@rhel7 ~]$ oc get svc -n netapp-astra-cc | egrep 'EXTERNAL|traefik'
