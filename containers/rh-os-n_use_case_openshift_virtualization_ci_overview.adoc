This section of the reference document provides details for integrating NetApp Cloud Insights with a Red Hat OpenShift Cluster to monitor OpenShift Virtualization VMs. 

NetApp Cloud Insights is a cloud infrastructure monitoring tool that gives you visibility into your complete infrastructure. With Cloud Insights, you can monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize all your resources including your public clouds and your private data centers. For more information about NetApp Cloud Insights, refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights[Cloud Insights documentation].

To start using Cloud Insights, you must sign up on the NetApp BlueXP portal. For details, refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_cloud_insights_onboarding_1.html[Cloud Insights Onboarding]

Cloud Insights has several features that enable you to quickly and easily find data, troubleshoot issues, and provide insights into your environment. You can find data easily with powerful queries, you can visualize data in dashboards, and send email alerts for data thresholds you set. Refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_feature_tutorials.html#introduction[video tutorials] to help you understand these features.

For Cloud Insights to start collecting data you need the following

**Data Collectors**
There are 3 types of Data Collectors:
* Infrastructure (storage devices, network switches, compute infrastructure)
* Operating Systems (such as VMware or Windows)
* Services (such as Kafka)

Data Collectors discover information from the data sources, such as ONTAP storage device (infrastructure data collector). The information gathered is used for analysis, validation, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

**Acquisition Unit**
If you are using an infrastructure Data Collector, you also need an Acquisition Unit to inject data into Cloud Insights. An Acquisition Unit is a computer dedicated to hosting data collectors, typically a Virtual Machine. This computer is typically located in the same data center/VPC as the monitored items.

**Telegraf Agents**
Cloud Insights also supports  Telegraf as its agent for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent that can be used to collect and report metrics, events, and logs.
