= Installation of OADP Operator
:hardbreaks:

== Prerequisites

*	A Red Hat OpenShift cluster (later than version 4.12) installed on bare-metal infrastructure with RHCOS worker nodes
*	A NetApp ONTAP cluster integrated with the cluster using Astra Trident
*	A Trident backend configured with an SVM on ONTAP cluster
*	A StorageClass configured on the OpenShift cluster with Astra Trident as the provisioner
*   Trident Snapshot class created on the cluster
*	Cluster-admin access to Red Hat OpenShift cluster
*	Admin access to NetApp ONTAP cluster
*   OpenShift Virtualization operator installed and configured
*   VMs deployed in a Namespace on OpenShift Virtualization
*	An admin workstation with tridentctl and oc tools installed and added to $PATH

NOTE: If you want to take a backup of a VM when it is in the Running state, then you must install the QEMU guest agent on that virtual machine. If you install the VM using an existing template, then QEMU agent is installed automatically. QEMU allows the guest agent to quiesce in-flight data in the guest OS during the snapshot process, and avoid possible data corruption. If you dont have QEMU installed, you can stop the virtual machine before taking a backup. 

== Steps to install OADP Operator

. Go to the Operator Hub of the cluster and select Red Hat OADP operator. In the Install page, use all the default selections and click install. On the next page, again use all the defaults and click Install. The OADP operator will be installed in the namespace called openshift-adp.

=== Prerequisites for Velero configuration to use Ontap S3: 
After the installation of the operator succeeds, configure the instance of Velero.
Velero can be configured to use S3 compatible Object Storage Configure ONTAP S3 using the procedures shown in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/object-storage-management/index.html[Object Storage Management section of ONTAP documentation]. You will need the following information from your ONTAP S3 configuration to integrate with Velero.

* A Logical Interface (LIF)IP that can be used to access S3
* User credentials to access S3 that includes the access key and the secret access key
* A bucket name in S3 for backups with access permissions for the user
* For secure access to the Object storage, TLS certificate should be installed on the Object Storage server. 

=== Steps to configure Velero

* First, create a secret for the ONTAP S3 user credentials. This will be used to configure Velero later. You can create a secret from the CLI or from the web console.
To create a secret from the web console, select Secrets, then click on Key/Value Secret.
Provide the values for the credential name, key and the value as shown. Be sure to use the Access Key Id and Secret Access Key of your S3 user.

image::redhat_openshift_OADP_install_image5.jpg[Create Secret for ONTAP S3 credentials]

NOTE: To create the default secret named cloud credentials from the CLI you can use the following command. If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you just need to create the default secret as shown above. For other scenarios, please see the OADP documentation.

* Next, to Configure Velero, select Installed Operators from the menu item under Operators, click on OADP operator, and then select the DataProtectionApplication tab.

image::redhat_openshift_OADP_install_image7.jpg[DataProtectionApplication]

Click on Create DataProtectionApplication. In the form view, provide a name for the DataProtection Application or use the default name.

Now go to the YAML view and replace the default information or add the information as shown in the yaml file below.

....
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: 'true' //use this for https communication with ONTAP S3
          profile: default
          region: us-east
          s3ForcePathStyle: 'True' //This allows use of IP in s3URL
          s3Url: 'https://10.xx.xx.xx' //Ensure TLS certificate for S3 is configured 
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials //previously created secret named cloud-credentials 
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: velero //Your bucket name previously created in S3 for backups
          prefix: demobackup //The folder that will be created in the bucket
        provider: aws
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia 
                    //default Data Mover uses Kopia to move snapshots to Object  Storage
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
        - csi //Add this plugin 
        - openshift
        - aws
        - kubevirt //Add this plugin
  snapshotLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          profile: default
          region: us-east
        provider: aws
....

The above YAML has the following sections in the spec that needs to be configured appropriately:

**backupLocations**
ONTAP S3 (with its credentials and other information as shown in the yaml) is configured as the default BackupLocation for velero.

**snapshotLocations**
ONTAP S3 is configured as the default location for PVC snapshots for Velero.

**Enable CSI**
Add csi to the defaultPlugins for Velero to back up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots. 
The Velero CSI plugins, to backup CSI backed PVCs, will choose the VolumeSnapshotClass in the cluster that has **velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class** label set on it.

You must have the trident VolumeSnapshotClass created.

Edit the label of the trident-snapshotclass and set it to 
**velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true** as shown below.

image::redhat_openshift_OADP_install_image9.jpg[Trident Snapshot class Label]

Ensure that the snapshots can persist even if the VolumeSnapshot objects are deleted. This can be done by setting the deletionPolicy to Retain. If not, deleting a namespace will completely lose all PVCs ever backed up in it.

....
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: trident-snapshotclass
driver: csi.trident.netapp.io
deletionPolicy: Retain
....

image::redhat_openshift_OADP_install_image10.jpg[VolumeSnapshotClass deletion Policy should be set to Retain]

Ensure that the DataProtectionApplication is created and is in condition:Reconciled.

The OADP operator will create a corresponding BackupStorageLocation.This will be used when creating a backup.
