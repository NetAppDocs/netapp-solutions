== Overview
This section provides details for setting up FSx for NetApp ONTAP as the default Storage Class for the ROSA cluster, and then create a Virtual Machine that will leverage FSx ONTAP storage for its volumes. 

We will also look into connecting to the Virtual Machine using the guest credentials, and restarting the VM. And finally, we will perform a live migration of the Virtual Machine from the current node to a new node. We will examine the contents of the disk storage after a VM restart and the live migration.

*   Trident 25.02 or later
You can leverage Trident 25.02 or later releases to easily setup the worker nodes of the ROSA cluster to perform iSCSI operations on FSxN storage. Install Trident 25.02 or later on ROSA cluster using the node-prep-flag 
[source,yaml]
....
#./tridentctl install trident -n trident --node-prep=iscsi
....

This will prepare the ROSA cluster worker nodes for iSCSI by starting the iscsid and multipathd services and setting the following in /etc/multipath.conf file

== Initial Setup

This section shows how to set up the default storage class to be trident-csi and the default VolumeSnapshotClass to be the FSx Volume Snapshot class. Then it shows how to create a VM from a template  and then connect and login to it using the guest credentials.


Ensure default Storage Class is set to trident-csi

Ensure default VolumeSnapShotClasses is set as shown
image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image2.png[OCP-v default VolumeSnapshot Class]

If the defaults are not set, you can set it up either from the console or from command line
[source]
$ oc patch storageclass trident-csi -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"}}}'

[source]
$ oc patch VolumeSnapshotClasses fsx-snapclass -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"}}}'

=== **Create a VM from the template**

Use the web console to create a VM from a template.
From the RedHat OpenShiftService on AWS console, create a virtual machine. There are templates available on the cluster that can be used to create the VM.
In the screenshot below, we choose fedora VM from this list. Give the VM a name,and then click on **Customize Virtual Machine**. Select the **Disks** tab and click on **Add disks**.
Change the name of the disk preferably to something meaningful, ensure that **trident-csi** is selected for storage class. Click on **Save**. Click on **Create VirtualMachine**

After a few minutes, the VM is in the running state

=== **Review all the objects created for the VM**

The storage disks.
image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image9.png[OCP-v Storage Disks]

The file systems of the VM will show the Partitions, File system type and the Mount points.
image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image10.png[OCP-v FileSystems]

2 PVCs are created for the VM, one from the boot disk and one for the hot plug disk.
image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image11.png[OCP-v VM PVCs]

The PVC for the boot disk shows that the Access mode is ReadWriteMany, and the Storage Class is trident-csi.
image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image12.png[OCP-v VM boot disk PVC]

Similarly, the PVC for the hot-plug disk shows that the Access mode is ReadWriteMany, and the Storage Class is trident-csi.
image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image13.png[OCP-v VM hotplug disk PVC]

In the screenshot below we can see that the pod for the VM has a Status of Running.
image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image14.png[OCP-v VM running]

Here we can see the two Volumes associated with the VM pod and the 2 PVCs associated with them.

=== **Connect to the VM**

Click on ‘Open web console’ button, and login using Guest Credentials
image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image16.png[OCP-v VM connect]

image:redhat_openshift_ocpv_rosa_image17.png[OCP-v login]

Issue the following commands

[source]
$ df (to display information about the disk space usage on a file system).

[source]
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=random.dat bs=1M count=10240 (to create a file called random.dat in the home dir and fill it with random data).

The disk is filled with 11 GB of data.

Use vi to create a sample text file that we will use to test.
