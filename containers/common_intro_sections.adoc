Enterprises are increasingly adopting DevOps practices to create new products, shorten release cycles, and rapidly add new features. Because of their innate agile nature, containers and microservices play a crucial role in supporting DevOps practices. However, practicing DevOps at a production scale in an enterprise environment presents its own challenges and imposes certain requirements on the underlying infrastructure, such as the following:

* High availability at all layers in the stack

* Ease of deployment procedures

* Non-disruptive operations and upgrades

* API-driven and programmable infrastructure to keep up with microservices agility

* Multitenancy with performance guarantees

* Ability to run virtualized and containerized workloads simultaneously

* Ability to scale infrastructure independently based on workload demands
