Enterprises are increasingly adopting DevOps practices to create new products, shorten release cycles, and rapidly add new features. Because of their innate agile nature, containers and microservices play a crucial role in supporting DevOps practices. However, practicing DevOps at a production scale in an enterprise environment presents its own challenges and imposes certain requirements on the underlying infrastructure, such as the following:

* High availability at all layers in the stack

* Ease of deployment procedures

* Non-disruptive operations and upgrades

* API-driven and programmable infrastructure to keep up with microservices agility

* Multitenancy with performance guarantees

* Ability to run virtualized and containerized workloads simultaneously

* Ability to scale infrastructure independently based on workload demands

* AFF and FAS systems run NetApp ONTAP and provide storage for both file-based (NFS) and block-based (iSCSI) use cases.

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP Select provide the same benefits in the cloud and virtual space respectively.

* NetApp Cloud Volumes Service (AWS/GCP) and Azure NetApp Files provide file-based storage in the cloud.

* NetApp Element storage systems provide for block-based (iSCSI) use cases in a highly scalable environment.


NOTE: Each storage system in the NetApp portfolio can ease both data management and movement between on-premises sites and the cloud, ensuring that your data is where your applications are.


The following pages have additional information about the NetApp storage systems validated in the {solution_name} solution:

NetApp Astra Control Center offers a rich set of storage and application-aware data management services for stateful Kubernetes workloads deployed in an on-premises environment and powered by NetApp data protection technology.

NetApp Astra Control Center can be installed on a {k8s_distribution_name} cluster that has the Astra Trident storage orchestrator deployed and configured with storage classes and storage backends to NetApp ONTAP storage systems.

For the installation and configuration of Astra Trident to support Astra Control Center, see link:rh-os-n_overview_trident.html[this document here^].

In a cloud-connected environment, Astra Control Center uses Cloud Insights to provide advanced monitoring and telemetry. In the absence of a Cloud Insights connection, limited monitoring and telemetry (7-days worth of metrics) is available and exported to Kubernetes native monitoring tools (Prometheus and Grafana) through open metrics endpoints.

Astra Control Center is fully integrated into the NetApp AutoSupport and Active IQ ecosystem to provide support for users, provide assistance with troubleshooting, and display usage statistics.

In addition to the paid version of Astra Control Center, a 90-day evaluation license is available. The evaluation version is supported through the email and community (Slack channel). Customers have access to these and other knowledge-base articles and the documentation available from the in-product support dashboard.

Astra Trident is an open-source and fully supported storage orchestrator for containers and Kubernetes distributions, including {k8s_distribution_name}. Trident works with the entire NetApp storage portfolio, including the NetApp ONTAP and Element storage systems, and it also supports NFS and iSCSI connections. Trident  accelerates the DevOps workflow by allowing end users to provision and manage storage from their NetApp storage systems without requiring intervention from a storage administrator.

An administrator can configure a number of storage backends based on project needs and storage system models that enable advanced storage features, including compression, specific disk types, or QoS levels that guarantee a certain level of performance. After they are defined, these backends can be used by developers in their projects to create persistent volume claims (PVCs) and to attach persistent storage to their containers on demand.

Astra Trident has a rapid development cycle, and just like Kubernetes, is released four times a year.

The latest version of Astra Trident is 22.01 released in January 2022. A support matrix for what version of Trident has been tested with which Kubernetes distribution can be found https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/requirements.html#supported-frontends-orchestrators[here].

Starting with the 20.04 release, Trident setup is performed by the Trident operator. The operator makes large scale deployments easier and provides additional support including self healing for pods that are deployed as a part of the Trident install.

With the 21.01 release, a Helm chart was made available to ease the installation of the Trident Operator.
