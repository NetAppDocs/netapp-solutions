== VM cloning

Cloning an existing VM in OpenShift is achieved with the support of Astra Trident’s Volume CSI cloning feature. CSI volume cloning allows for creation of a new PVC using an existing PVC as the data source by duplicating its PV. After the new PVC is created, it functions as a separate entity and without any link to or dependency on the source PVC.

There are certain restrictions with CSI volume cloning to consider:

.	Source PVC and destination PVC must be in the same project.
.	Cloning is supported within the same storage class.
.	Cloning can be performed only when source and destination volumes use the same VolumeMode setting; for example, a block volume can only be cloned to another block volume.

VMs in an OpenShift cluster can be cloned in two ways:

.	By shutting down the source VM
.	By keeping the source VM live

=== By Shutting down the source VM

Cloning an existing VM by shutting down the VM is a native OpenShift feature that is implemented with support from Astra Trident. Complete the following steps to clone a VM.

.	Navigate to Workloads > Virtualization > Virtual Machines and click the ellipsis next to the virtual machine you wish to clone.
.	Click Clone Virtual Machine and provide the details for the new VM.

.	Click Clone Virtual Machine; this shuts down the source VM and initiates the creation of the clone VM.
.	After this step is completed, you can access and verify the content of the cloned VM.

=== By keeping the source VM live

An existing VM can also be cloned by cloning the existing PVC of the source VM and then creating a new VM using the cloned PVC. This method does not require you to shut down the source VM. Complete the following steps to clone a VM without shutting it down.

.	Navigate to Storage > PersistentVolumeClaims and click the ellipsis next to the PVC that is attached to the source VM.
.	Click Clone PVC and furnish the details for the new PVC.

.	Then click Clone. This creates a PVC for the new VM.
.	Navigate to Workloads > Virtualization > Virtual Machines and click Create > With YAML.
.	In the spec > template > spec > volumes section, attach the cloned PVC instead of the container disk. Provide all other details for the new VM according to your requirements.

.	Click Create to create the new VM.
.	After the VM is created successfully, access and verify that the new VM is a clone of the source VM.
