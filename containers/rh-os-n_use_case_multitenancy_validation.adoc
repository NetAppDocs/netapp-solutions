To validate the multitenant architecture that was configured in the previous steps, complete the following steps:

== Validate access to create PVCs or pods in assigned project

.	Log in as ocp-project-1-user, developer in project-1.
.	Check access to create a new project.
[source, console]
oc create ns sub-project-1

.	Create a PVC in project-1 using the storageclass that is assigned to project-1.
[source, console]
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: test-pvc-project-1
  namespace: project-1
  annotations:
    trident.netapp.io/reclaimPolicy: Retain
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: project-1-sc
EOF

.	Check the PV associated with the PVC.
[source, console]
oc get pv

.	Validate that the PV and its volume is created in an SVM dedicated to project-1 on NetApp ONTAP.
[source, console]
volume show -vserver project-1-svm

.	Create a pod in project-1 and mount the PVC created in previous step.
[source, console]
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: test-pvc-pod
  namespace: project-1
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: test-pvc-project-1
      persistentVolumeClaim:
       claimName: test-pvc-project-1
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: test-pvc-project-1
EOF

.	Check if the pod is running and whether it mounted the volume.
[source, console]
oc describe pods test-pvc-pod -n project-1

== Validate access to create PVCs or pods in another project or use resources dedicated to another project

.	Log in as ocp-project-1-user, developer in project-1.
.	Create a PVC in project-1 using the storageclass that is assigned to project-2.
[source, console]
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: test-pvc-project-1-sc-2
  namespace: project-1
  annotations:
    trident.netapp.io/reclaimPolicy: Retain
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: project-2-sc
EOF

.	Create a PVC in project-2.
[source, console]
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: test-pvc-project-2-sc-1
  namespace: project-2
  annotations:
    trident.netapp.io/reclaimPolicy: Retain
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: project-1-sc
EOF

.	Make sure that PVCs `test-pvc-project-1-sc-2` and `test-pvc-project-2-sc-1` were not created.
[source, console]
oc get pvc -n project-1
oc get pvc -n project-2

.	Create a pod in project-2.
[source, console]
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: test-pvc-pod
  namespace: project-1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
EOF

== Validate access to view and edit Projects, ResourceQuotas, and StorageClasses

.	Log in as ocp-project-1-user, developer in project-1.
.	Check access to create new projects.
[source, console]
oc create ns sub-project-1

.	Validate access to view projects.
[source, console]
oc get ns

.	Check if the user can view or edit ResourceQuotas in project-1.
[source, console]
oc get resourcequotas -n project-1
oc edit resourcequotas project-1-sc-rq -n project-1

.	Validate that the user has access to view the storageclasses.
[source, console]
oc get sc

.	Check access to describe the storageclasses.
.	Validate the userâ€™s access to edit the storageclasses.
[source, console]
oc edit sc project-1-sc
