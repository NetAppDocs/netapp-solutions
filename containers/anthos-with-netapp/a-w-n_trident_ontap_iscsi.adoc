To enable Trident integration with the NetApp ONTAP storage system, you must create a backend that enables communication with the storage system.

. There are sample backend files available in the downloaded installation archive in the `sample-input` folder hierarchy. For NetApp ONTAP systems serving iSCSI, copy the `backend-ontap-san.json` file to your working directory and edit the file.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ cp sample-input/backends-samples/ontap-san/backend-ontap-san.json ./
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ vi backend-ontap-san.json
----

. Edit the managementLIF, dataLIF, svm, username, and password values in this file.
+
----
{
  "version": 1,
  "storageDriverName": "ontap-san",
  "managementLIF": "172.21.224.201",
  "dataLIF": "10.61.181.240",
  "svm": "trident_svm",
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password"
}
----

. With this backend file in place, run the following command to create your first backend.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ ./tridentctl -n trident create backend -f backend-ontap-san.json
+------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+
|          NAME          | STORAGE DRIVER |                 UUID                 | STATE  | VOLUMES |
+------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+

. With the backend created, you must next create a storage class. Just as with the backend, there is a sample storage class file that can be edited for the environment available in the sample-inputs folder. Copy it to the working directory and make necessary edits to reflect the backend created.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ cp sample-input/storage-class-samples/storage-class-csi.yaml.templ ./storage-class-basic.yaml
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ vi storage-class-basic.yaml
----

. The only edit that must be made to this file is to define the `backendType` value to the name of the storage driver from the newly created backend. Also note the name-field value, which must be referenced in a later step.
+
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: basic-csi
provisioner: csi.trident.netapp.io
parameters:
  backendType: "ontap-san"
----
+
NOTE: There is an optional field called `fsType` that is defined in this file. In iSCSI backends, this value can be set to a specific Linux filesystem type (XFS, ext4, and so on), or it can be deleted to allow the worker node OS to decide which filesystem to use.

. Run the `kubectl` command to create the storage class.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ kubectl create -f storage-class-basic.yaml
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/basic-csi created
----

. With the storage class created, you must then create the first persistent volume claim (PVC). There is a sample `pvc-basic.yaml` file that can be used to perform this action located in sample-inputs as well.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ cp sample-input/pvc-samples/pvc-basic.yaml ./
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ vi pvc-basic.yaml
----

. The only edit that must be made to this file is ensuring that the `storageClassName` field matches the one just created. The PVC definition can be further customized as required by the workload to be provisioned.
+
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: basic-csi
----

. Create the PVC by issuing the `kubectl` command. Creation can take some time depending on the size of the backing volume being created, so you can watch the process as it completes.
+

[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ kubectl create -f pvc-basic.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/basic created

[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ kubectl get pvc
