== Anthos Ready storage partner program.

Google Cloud periodically requests updated validation of partner storage integrations with new releases of Anthos through their Anthos Ready storage partner program. A list of currently validated storage solutions, CSI drivers, available features, and the versions of Anthos supported can be found https://cloud.google.com/anthos/docs/resources/partner-storage[here^].

NetApp has maintained regular compliance on a quarterly basis with requests to validate our Astra Trident CSI-compliant storage orchestrator and our ONTAP storage system with versions of Anthos.

The following table contains the Anthos versions tested by NetApp and NetApp partner engineers for validation of NetApp Astra Trident CSI drivers and feature sets as a part of the Anthos Ready storage partner program:
