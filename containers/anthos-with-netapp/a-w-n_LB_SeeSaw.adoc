This page lists the installation and configuration instructions for the SeeSaw managed load balancer.

Seesaw is the default managed network load balancer installed in an Anthos Clusters on VMware environment from versions 1.6 to 1.10.

== Installing The SeeSaw load balancer

The SeeSaw load balancer is fully integrated with Anthos Clusters on VMware and has automated deployment performed as part of the Admin and User cluster setups. There are blocks of text in the `cluster.yaml` configuration files that must be modified to provide load balancer info, and then there is an additional step prior to cluster deployment to deploy the load balancer using the built in `gkectl` tool.

NOTE: SeeSaw load balancers can be deployed in HA or non-HA mode. For the purpose of this validation, the SeeSaw load balancer was deployed in non-HA mode, which is the default setting. For production purposes, NetApp recommends deploying SeeSaw in an HA configuration for fault tolerance and reliability.

== Integration with Anthos

There is a section in each configuration file, respectively for the admin cluster, and in each user cluster that you choose to deploy to configure the load balancer so that it is managed by Anthos On-Prem.

The following text is a sample from the configuration of the partition for the GKE-Admin cluster. The values that need to be uncommented and modified are placed in bold text below:

*loadBalancer:*
  # (Required) The VIPs to use for load balancing
  *vips:*
    # Used to connect to the Kubernetes API

    *cpus: 1*
  #   (Required) Memory size in MB per machine
    *memoryMB: 2048*
  #   (Optional) Network that the LB interface of Seesaw runs in (default: cluster
  #   network)
    *vCenter:*

      *networkName: VM_Network*
  #   (Optional) Run two LB VMs to achieve high availability (default: false)
    *enableHA: false*

The SeeSaw load balancer also has a separate static `seesaw-block.yaml` file that you must provide for each cluster deployment. This file must be located in the same directory relative to the `cluster.yaml` deployment file, or the full path must be specified in the section above.

A sample of the `admin-seesaw-block.yaml` file looks like the following script:

[subs="+quotes,+verbatim"]
----
blocks:
  - netmask: "255.255.255.0"
    gateway: "10.63.172.1"
    ips:
    - ip: "10.63.172.152"
      hostname: "admin-seesaw-vm"
----

NOTE: This file provides the gateway and netmask for the network that the load balancer provides to the underlying cluster, as well as the management IP and hostname for the virtual machine that is deployed to run the load balancer.
