* AFF and FAS systems run NetApp ONTAP and provide storage for both file-based (NFS) and block-based (iSCSI) use cases.

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP Select provide the same benefits in the cloud and virtual space respectively.

* NetApp Cloud Volumes Service (GCP) and Azure NetApp Files provide file-based storage in the cloud.

* Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a fully managed service on AWS that provides storage for file-based use cases. 

NOTE: Each storage system in the NetApp portfolio can ease both data management and movement between on-premises sites and the cloud, ensuring that your data is where your applications are.
