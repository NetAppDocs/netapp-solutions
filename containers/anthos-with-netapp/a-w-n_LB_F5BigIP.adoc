F5 BIG-IP is an Application Delivery Controller (ADC) that offers a broad set of advanced, production-grade traffic management and security services like L4-L7 load balancing, SSL/TLS offload, DNS, firewall, and more. These services dramatically increase the availability, security, and performance of your applications.

F5 BIG-IP can be deployed and consumed in various ways, including on dedicated hardware, in the cloud, or as a virtual appliance on-premises. Refer to the documentation here to explore and deploy F5 BIG-IP.

F5 BIG-IP was the first of the bundled load balancer solutions available with Anthos On-Prem and was used in a number of the early Anthos Ready partner validations for the Anthos with NetApp solution.

NOTE: F5 BIG-IP can be deployed in standalone mode or in cluster mode. For the purpose of this validation, F5 BIG-IP was deployed in standalone mode. However, for production purposes, NetApp recommends creating a cluster of BIG-IP instances to avoid a single point of failure.

NOTE: An F5 BIG-IP system can be deployed on dedicated hardware, in the cloud, or as a virtual appliance on-premises with versions greater than 12.x for it to be integrated with F5 CIS. For the purpose of this document, the F5 BIG-IP system was validated as a virtual appliance, for example using the BIG-IP VE edition.

== Validated releases

This solution makes use of the virtual appliance deployed in VMware vSphere. Networking for the F5 Big-IP virtual appliance can be configured in a two-armed or three-armed configuration based on your network environment. The deployment in this document is based on the two-armed configuration. Additional details on configuring the virtual appliance for use with Anthos can be found https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/installing-f5-big-ip-adc-for-gke-on-prem[here].

The Solutions Engineering Team at NetApp have validated the releases in the following table in our lab to work with deployments of Anthos On-Prem:

|===
|Make  | Type | Version
|F5  | BIG-IP VE | 15.0.1-0.0.11
|F5  | BIG-IP VE | 16.1.0-0.0.19
|===

== Installation

To install F5 BIG-IP, complete the following steps:

. Download the virtual application Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) file from F5 https://downloads.f5.com/esd/serveDownload.jsp?path=/big-ip/big-ip_v15.x/15.0.1/english/virtual-edition/&sw=BIG-IP&pro=big-ip_v15.x&ver=15.0.1&container=Virtual-Edition&file=BIGIP-15.0.1-0.0.11.ALL-vmware.ova[here].
+
NOTE:	To download the appliance, a user must register with F5. They provide a 30-day demo license for the Big-IP Virtual Edition Load Balancer. NetApp recommends a permanent 10Gbps license for the production deployment of an appliance.

. Right-click the Infrastructure Resource Pool and select Deploy OVF Template. A wizard launches that allows you to select the OVA file that you just downloaded in Step 1. Click Next.

. Click Next to continue through each step and accept the default values for each screen presented until you reach the storage selection screen. Select the VM_Datastore that you would like to deploy the virtual machine to, and then click Next.

. The next screen presented by the wizard allows you to customize the virtual networks for use in the environment. Select VM_Network for the External field and select Management_Network for the Management field. Internal and HA are used for advanced configurations for the F5 Big-IP appliance and are not configured. These parameters can be left alone, or they can be configured to connect to non-infrastructure, distributed port groups. Click Next.
