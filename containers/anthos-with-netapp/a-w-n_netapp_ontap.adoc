NetApp ONTAP is a powerful storage-software tool with capabilities such as an intuitive GUI, REST APIs with automation integration, AI-informed predictive analytics and corrective action, nondisruptive hardware upgrades, and cross-storage import.

For more information about the NetApp ONTAP storage system, visit the https://www.netapp.com/data-management/ontap-data-management-software/[NetApp ONTAP website^].

ONTAP provides the following features:

* A unified storage system with simultaneous data access and management of NFS, CIFS, iSCSI, FC, FCoE, and FC-NVMe protocols.
* Different deployment models include on-premises on all-flash, hybrid, and all-HDD hardware configurations; VM-based storage platforms on a supported hypervisor such as ONTAP Select; and in the cloud as Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* Increased data storage efficiency on ONTAP systems with support for automatic data tiering, inline data compression, deduplication, and compaction.
* Workload-based, QoS-controlled storage.
* Seamless integration with a public cloud for tiering and protection of data. ONTAP also provides robust data protection capabilities that sets it apart in any environment:

** *NetApp Snapshot copies.* A fast, point-in-time backup of data using a minimal amount of disk space with no additional performance overhead.
** *NetApp SnapMirror.* Mirrors the Snapshot copies of data from one storage system to another. ONTAP supports mirroring data to other physical platforms and cloud-native services as well.
** *NetApp SnapLock.*  Efficiently administration of nonrewritable data by writing it to special volumes that cannot be overwritten or erased for a designated period.
** *NetApp SnapVault.* Backs up data from multiple storage systems to a central Snapshot copy that serves as a backup to all designated systems.
** *NetApp SyncMirror.* Provides real-time, RAID-level mirroring of data to two different plexes of disks that are connected physically to the same controller.
** *NetApp SnapRestore.* Provides fast restoration of backed-up data on demand from Snapshot copies.
** *NetApp FlexClone.* Provides instantaneous provisioning of a fully readable and writeable copy of a NetApp volume based on a Snapshot copy.

NOTE: NetApp ONTAP is available on-premises, virtualized, or in the cloud.

== NetApp platforms

=== NetApp AFF/FAS

NetApp provides robust all-flash (AFF) and scale-out hybrid (FAS) storage platforms that are tailor-made with low-latency performance, integrated data protection, and multiprotocol support.

Both systems are powered by NetApp ONTAP data management software, the industry’s most advanced data-management software for highly-available, cloud-integrated, simplified storage management to deliver the enterprise-class speed, efficiency, and security your data fabric needs.

For more information about NETAPP AFF and FAS platforms, click https://docs.netapp.com/platstor/index.jsp[here].

=== ONTAP Select

ONTAP Select is a software-defined deployment of NetApp ONTAP that can be deployed onto a hypervisor in your environment. It can be installed on VMware vSphere or on KVM and provides the full functionality and experience of a hardware-based ONTAP system.

For more information about ONTAP Select, click https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-select/[here].

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP

NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP is a cloud-deployed version of NetApp ONTAP available to be deployed in a number of public clouds, including: Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.
