NetApp Astra Control Center offers a rich set of storage and application-aware data management services for stateful Kubernetes workloads deployed in an on-premises environment and powered by NetApp data protection technology.

NetApp Astra Control Center can be installed on a Red Hat OpenShift cluster that has the Astra Trident storage orchestrator deployed and configured with storage classes and storage backends to NetApp ONTAP storage systems.

For the installation and configuration of Astra Trident to support Astra Control Center, see link:rh-os-n_overview_trident.html[this document^].

In a cloud-connected environment, Astra Control Center uses Cloud Insights to provide advanced monitoring and telemetry. In the absence of a Cloud Insights connection, limited monitoring and telemetry (7 days worth of metrics) is available and exported to Kubernetes native monitoring tools (Prometheus and Grafana) through open metrics endpoints.

Astra Control Center is fully integrated into the NetApp AutoSupport and Active IQ ecosystem to provide support for users, provide assistance with troubleshooting, and display usage statistics.

In addition to the paid version of Astra Control Center, a 90-day evaluation license is available. The evaluation version is supported through email and the community Slack channel. Customers have access to these resources, other knowledge-base articles, and documentation available from the in-product support dashboard.

== Astra Control Center installation prerequisites

.	One or more Red Hat OpenShift clusters. Versions 4.6 EUS and 4.7 are currently supported.

.	Astra Trident must already be installed and configured on each Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

.	One or more NetApp ONTAP storage systems running ONTAP 9.5 or greater.
+
NOTE: It's a best practice for each OpenShift install at a site to have a dedicated SVM for persistent storage. Multi-site deployments require additional storage systems.

.	A Trident storage backend must be configured on each OpenShift cluster with an SVM backed by an ONTAP cluster.

.	A default StorageClass configured on each OpenShift cluster with Astra Trident as the storage provisioner.

.	A load balancer must be installed and configured on each OpenShift cluster for load balancing and exposing OpenShift Services.
+
NOTE: See the link link:rh-os-n_load_balancers.html[here] for information about load balancers that have been validated for this purpose.

.	A private image registry must be configured to host the NetApp Astra Control Center images.
+
NOTE: See the link link:rh-os-n_private_registry.html[here] to install and configure an OpenShift private registry for this purpose.

.	You must have Cluster Admin access to the Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

.	You must have Admin access to NetApp ONTAP clusters.

.	An admin workstation with docker or podman, tridentctl, and oc or kubectl tools installed and added to your $PATH.
+
NOTE: Docker installations must have a docker version greater than 20.10, and Podman installations must have a podman version greater than 3.0.
