To enable Trident integration with the NetApp Element storage system, you must create a backend that enables communication with the storage system using the iSCSI protocol.

. There are sample backend files available in the downloaded installation archive in the `sample-input` folder hierarchy. For NetApp Element systems serving iSCSI, copy the `backend-solidfire.json` file to your working directory and edit the file.

[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ cp sample-input/backends-samples/solidfire/backend-solidfire.json ./
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ vi ./backend-solidfire.json
----

.. Edit the user, password, and MVIP value on the `EndPoint` line.
.. Edit the `SVIP` value.

 {
    "version": 1,
    "storageDriverName": "solidfire-san",
    "Endpoint": "https://trident:password@172.21.224.150/json-rpc/8.0",
    "SVIP": "10.61.180.200:3260",
    "TenantName": "trident",
    "Types": [{"Type": "Bronze", "Qos": {"minIOPS": 1000, "maxIOPS": 2000, "burstIOPS": 4000}},
              {"Type": "Silver", "Qos": {"minIOPS": 4000, "maxIOPS": 6000, "burstIOPS": 8000}},
              {"Type": "Gold", "Qos": {"minIOPS": 6000, "maxIOPS": 8000, "burstIOPS": 10000}}]
}
----

. With this back-end file in place, run the following command to create your first backend.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ ./tridentctl -n trident create backend -f backend-solidfire.json

. With the backend created, you must next create a storage class. Just as with the backend, there is a sample storage class file that can be edited for the environment available in the sample-inputs folder. Copy it to the working directory and make necessary edits to reflect the backend created.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ cp sample-input/storage-class-samples/storage-class-csi.yaml.templ ./storage-class-basic.yaml
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ vi storage-class-basic.yaml
----

. The only edit that must be made to this file is to define the `backendType` value to the name of the storage driver from the newly created backend. Also note the name-field value, which must be referenced in a later step.
+
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: basic-csi
provisioner: csi.trident.netapp.io
parameters:
  backendType: "solidfire-san"
----
+
NOTE: There is an optional field called `fsType` that is defined in this file. In iSCSI backends, this value can be set to a specific Linux filesystem type (XFS, ext4, and so on), or it can be deleted to allow OpenShift to decide what filesystem to use.

. Run the `kubectl` command to create the storage class.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ kubectl create -f storage-class-basic.yaml
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/basic-csi created
----

. With the storage class created, you must then create the first persistent volume claim (PVC). There is a sample `pvc-basic.yaml` file that can be used to perform this action located in sample-inputs as well.
+
----
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ cp sample-input/pvc-samples/pvc-basic.yaml ./
[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ vi pvc-basic.yaml
----

. The only edit that must be made to this file is ensuring that the `storageClassName` field matches the one just created. The PVC definition can be further customized as required by the workload to be provisioned.
+
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: basic-csi
----

. Create the PVC by issuing the `kubectl` command. Creation can take some time depending on the size of the backing volume being created, so you can watch the process as it completes.
+

[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ kubectl create -f pvc-basic.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/basic created

[ubuntu@gke-admin-ws-2022-05-03 trident-installer]$ kubectl get pvc
