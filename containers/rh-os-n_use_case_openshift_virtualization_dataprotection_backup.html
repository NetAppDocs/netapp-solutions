== Steps to create a backup of a VM

To create an on-demand backup of the entire VM (VM metadata and VM disks), click on the **Backup** tab.
You can use the following yaml. Here the VM and its disks in the specified namespace will be backed up. 
A snapshot of the persistent volumes backing the disks will be created by the CSI and will be moved to the object storage location provided in the yaml. 
The backup will remain in the system for 30 days as specified in the ttl.

....
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup1
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec: 
  includedNamespaces:
  - virtual-machines-demo
  snapshotVolumes: true
  storageLocation: velero-demo-1
  ttl: 720h0m0s

  ....


Once the backup completes, its Phase should show as completed.

You can inspect the backup in the Object storage with the help of an S3 browser application.
The path of the backup shows in the configured bucket with the prefix name (velero/demobackup). 
You can see the contents contain the volume snapshots logs and other metadata of the virtual machine.
