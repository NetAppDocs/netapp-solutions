= 8. Deploy the Admin and the First User Cluster

All Kubernetes clusters deployed as a part of the Anthos solution are deployed from the Anthos admin workstation that you just created. A user logs into the admin workstation using SSH, the public key created in a previous step, and the IP address provided at the end of the VM deployment. They can then begin creating their first clusters.

NOTE:	There are specific procedures for deploying clusters that use static IP addresses https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/docs/how-to/installation/install-static-ips[here], and procedures for environments with DHCP can be found https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/docs/how-to/installation/install-dhcp[here]. In this guide, we use the second set of instructions.

To deploy the initial admin and first user cluster, complete the following steps:

1. Login to the admin workstation using the SSH public key and the IP address output at the end of Terraform deployment.

2.	Log in with the `gcloud auth` command as you did before from your deployment workstation by copying the URL into a web browser, signing into your Google account, and pasting the verification code back into the workstation.
+
----
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ gcloud auth login
Go to the following link in your browser:

    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?code_challenge=Q1F7H-CMUMuArasQD6AzHA0avKolGfDqUyUgjFxf9ZI&prompt=select_account&code_challenge_method=S256&access_type=offline&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&client_id=32555940559.apps.googleusercontent.com&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcloud-platform+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fappengine.admin+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcompute+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Faccounts.reauth

Enter verification code: 6/swFG_ZKZyd0eblfuXsgtnBgYrIt1XwFQeB5ASrEQaaDfa09aio0bnNg

WARNING: `gcloud auth login` no longer writes application default credentials.
If you need to use ADC, see:
  gcloud auth application-default --help

You are now logged in as [user@netapp.com].
Your current project is [None].  You can change this setting by running:
  $ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
----

3. Set the project that you intend to deploy your clusters in for Anthos on VMware, because the project is not set by default when you log in.
+
----
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ gcloud config set project anthos-dev
Updated property [core/project].
----

4. Register gcloud as a Docker credential helper, which enables it to manage the credentials for Docker registries used for deployment. This way, the default credential store is not used for operations involving the credentials of the specified registries.
+
----
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ gcloud auth configure-docker
The following settings will be added to your Docker config file
located at [/home/ubuntu/.docker/config.json]:
 {
  "credHelpers": {
    "gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "us.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "eu.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "asia.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "staging-k8s.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "marketplace.gcr.io": "gcloud"
  }
}

Do you want to continue (Y/n)?  y

Docker configuration file updated.
----
+

NOTE:	By default, Anthos on VMware uses a pre-existing, Google-owned container image registry that requires no additional setup. If you choose to use a private Docker registry for deployment, then you must configure that registry separately based on instructions found https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/docs/how-to/installation/install-dhcp/#using_docker_for_instalation[here]. This step is beyond the scope of this deployment guide.

5. In the next step to deploy an admin cluster, create a private key file in the JSON format for each of the service accounts created in the prerequisites section.
+
----
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ gcloud iam service-accounts list
NAME           EMAIL                                                                  DISABLED

----

6. For the next step, you must use the access service key created in the previous step to activate the associated service account.
+
----
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=access-key.json
Activated service account credentials for: [access-service-account@anthos-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com]
----

7. The deployment of the first clusters is performed using inputs from a config file generated by GKE. A generic config file can be created with no additional input, or an existing config file can be referenced to create additional clusters.
+
----
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ gkectl create-config
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ ls
access-key.json  config.yaml  connect-key.json  register-key.json  stackdriver-key.json
----

8. The `config.yaml` file created by running the previous command has several variables that must be customized for the current environment.

a. First, you must determine the full path location and the name of the current GKE bundle that is deployed into the environment. The file exists in the `/var/lib/gke/bundles` directory on the admin workstation.
+
----
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ ls /var/lib/gke/bundles
gke-onprem-vsphere-1.1.1-gke.2-full.tgz  gke-onprem-vsphere-1.1.1-gke.2.tgz
----

b. Next, you must get the fully recognized host name or IP address of our vCenter Server as displayed in its default SSL certificate. Connect to vSphere and dump the certificate contents into a file called `vcenter.pem`. Examining this file gives you the information that you need for the value of `Subject: CN` (common name).
+
----
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ true | openssl s_client -connect anthos-vc.cie.netapp.com:443 -showcerts 2>/dev/null | sed -ne '/-BEGIN/,/-END/p' > vcenter.pem
ubuntu@admin-workstation:~$ openssl x509 -in vcenter.pem -text -noout | grep Subject:\ CN
        Subject: CN = anthos-vc.cie.netapp.com, C = US
----
+

NOTE:	If the value added to the `config.yaml` file does not match that of the CN found in the certificate, communication with the vCenter server fails.

9. With the information from those two commands and the generated `vcenter.pem` file, we can now edit the `config.yaml` file to prepare for deployment. Editing this file is very similar to the edits that you performed to the `terraform.tfvars` file to provide specifics regarding the VMware vCenter instance deployed in NetApp HCI.
+

NOTE:	When deploying the cluster, determine which IP addresses to use for the control plane and ingress VIPs for both the admin and user cluster. Also determine the compute and memory resources that must be reserved for each node deployed, because it is not possible to edit a cluster after it has been deployed.

10. Because spacing in YAML files can be very important, you can check the syntax of the config file by running the following command. If the command outputs any failures, be sure to examine the file and make any needed corrections.

NOTE:	Using DHCP skips the step to validate node IP availability. This is an expected behavior and deployment can continue.

11. Preparing the cluster for deployment and deploying the cluster are performed with two commands:

a. The `gkectl prepare` command initializes the vSphere environment by uploading the node OS image, marking it as a template, and validating the build attestations for all container images.

b.	The `gkectl create cluster` command deploys the cluster as depicted in the `config.yaml` file.

c.	The process runs for several minutes and can be monitored on screen and in vCenter by watching the resource pool as the VMs populate. When complete, you should be able to see the `gke-admin` cluster (three nodes) and the first user cluster (four nodes).
+

NOTE:	During the deployment process, the standard out might display several messages about the current node not being available or not being ready. This is normal and happens when the control plane checks for machines that have not yet completed deployment or received DHCP addresses.
+

NOTE:	When using DHCP, if a deployment fails because nodes cannot be reached, there might not be enough available addresses in the pool. Leases for previously failed deployments might need to be cleared manually to allow for additional deployment attempts.
