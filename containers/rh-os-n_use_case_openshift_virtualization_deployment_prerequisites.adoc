== Prerequisites

*	A Red Hat OpenShift cluster (later than version 4.6) installed on bare-metal infrastructure with RHCOS worker nodes
*	The OpenShift cluster must be installed via installer provisioned infrastructure (IPI)
*	Deploy Machine Health Checks to maintain HA for VMs
*	A NetApp ONTAP cluster
*	Astra Trident installed on the OpenShift cluster
*	A Trident backend configured with an SVM on ONTAP cluster
*	A StorageClass configured on the OpenShift cluster with Astra Trident as the provisioner
*	Cluster-admin access to Red Hat OpenShift cluster
*	Admin access to NetApp ONTAP cluster
*	An admin workstation with tridentctl and oc tools installed and added to $PATH

Because OpenShift Virtualization is managed by an operator installed on the OpenShift cluster, it imposes additional overhead on memory, CPU, and storage, which must be accounted for while planning the hardware requirements for the cluster. See the documentation https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/virt/install/preparing-cluster-for-virt.html#virt-cluster-resource-requirements_preparing-cluster-for-virt[here] for more details.

Optionally, you can also specify a subset of the OpenShift cluster nodes to host the OpenShift Virtualization operators, controllers, and VMs by configuring node placement rules. To configure node placement rules for OpenShift Virtualization, follow the documentation https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/virt/install/virt-specifying-nodes-for-virtualization-components.html[here].

For the storage backing OpenShift Virtualization, NetApp recommends having a dedicated StorageClass that requests storage from a particular Trident backend, which in turn is backed by a dedicated SVM. This maintains a level of multitenancy with regard to the data being served for VM-based workloads on the OpenShift cluster.
