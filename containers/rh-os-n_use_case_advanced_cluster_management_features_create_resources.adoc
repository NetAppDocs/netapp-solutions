== Create resources on multiple clusters

Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes allows users to create resources on one or more managed clusters simultaneously from the console. As an example, if you have OpenShift clusters at different sites backed with different NetApp ONTAP clusters and want to provision PVC's at both sites, you can click the (+) sign on the top bar. Then select the clusters on which you want to create the PVC, paste the resource YAML, and click Create.
