**1. Create a Snapshot of the app volume**
In this section, we will show how to create a trident snapshot of the volume associated with the app.This will be a point in time copy of the app data. If the application data is lost, we can recover the data from this point in time copy. 
NOTE: This snapshot is stored in the same aggregate as the original volume in ONTAP(on-premises or in the cloud). So if the ONTAP storage aggregate is lost, we cannot recover the app data from its snapshot. 

**a. Create a VolumeSnapshotClass
Save the following manifest in a file called volume-snapshot-class.yaml
[source]
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
 name: fsx-snapclass
driver: csi.trident.netapp.io
deletionPolicy: Delete

Create a snapshot by using the above manifest.

**b. Next, create a snapshot**
Create a snapshot of the existing PVC by creating VolumeSnapshot to take a point-in-time copy of your Postgresql data. This creates an FSx snapshot that takes almost no space in the filesystem backend. Save the following manifest in a file called volume-snapshot.yaml:
[source]
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
 name: postgresql-volume-snap-01
spec:
 volumeSnapshotClassName: fsx-snapclass
 source:
   persistentVolumeClaimName: data-postgresql-0

**c. Create the volume snapshot and confirm that it is created**

Delete the database to simulate the loss of data (data loss can happen due to a variety of reasons, here we are just simulating it by deleting the database)

**d. Delete the database to simulate the loss of data (data loss can happen due to a variety of reasons, here we are just simulating it by deleting the database)**
