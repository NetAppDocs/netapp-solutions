For any multitenant solution, no user can have access to more cluster resources than is required. So, the entire set of resources that are to be configured as part of the multitenancy configuration is divided between cluster-admin, storage-admin, and developers working on each project.

The following table outlines the different tasks to be performed by different users:

|Role | Tasks

.4+| *Cluster-admin*

|	Create ClusterRoles and RoleBindings for storage-admin
|	Create Roles and RoleBindings for developers assigning access to specific projects
