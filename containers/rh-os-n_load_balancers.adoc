In most cases, Red Hat OpenShift makes applications available to the outside world through routes. A service is exposed by giving it an externally reachable hostname. The defined route and the endpoints identified by its service can be consumed by an OpenShift router to provide this named connectivity to external clients.

However in some cases, applications require the deployment and configuration of customized load balancers to expose the appropriate services. One example of this is NetApp Astra Control Center. To meet this need, we have evaluated a number of custom load balancer options. Their installation and configuration are described in this section.

The following pages have additional information about load balancer options validated in the Red Hat OpenShift with NetApp solution:
