== Astra Control Center Automation

Astra Control Center has a full-blown REST API for programmatic access. Users can use any programming language or utility to interact with Astra Control REST API endpoints. To learn more about it, check out the documentation link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[here^].

If developers are looking for a ready-made software development toolkit for interacting with Astra Control REST APIs, NetApp provides a toolkit with Astra Control Python SDK. To try it yourself, head on to link:https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-astra-toolkits/[NetApp Astra Toolkits^].

Furthermore, there are scenarios where programming is not an ideal choice and users just want to utilize a configuration management tool. In such scenarios, users can clone and run the Ansible playbooks that NetApp publishes link:https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_astra_control_suite[here^].
