== Astra Control Center automation

Astra Control Center has a fully functional REST API for programmatic access. Users can use any programming language or utility to interact with Astra Control REST API endpoints. To learn more about this API, see the documentation link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[here^].

If you are looking for a ready-made software development toolkit for interacting with Astra Control REST APIs, NetApp provides a toolkit with Astra Control Python SDK,  which you can download link:https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-astra-toolkits/[here^].

If programming is not apropriate for your situation and you would like to use a configuration management tool, you can clone and run the Ansible playbooks that NetApp publishes link:https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_astra_control_suite[here^].
