Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) is a managed service that you can use to build, scale, and deploy containerized applications with the Red Hat OpenShift enterprise Kubernetes platform on AWS. ROSA streamlines moving on-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS, and offers tight integration with other AWS services.
