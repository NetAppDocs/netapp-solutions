This diagram shows the ROSA cluster deployed in multiple AZs. ROSA cluster’s master nodes, infrastructure nodes are in Red Hat’s VPC, while the worker nodes are in a VPC in the customer's account . We’ll create an FSx for ONTAP file system within the same VPC and install the Trident driver in the ROSA cluster, allowing all the subnets of this VPC to connect to the file system.
