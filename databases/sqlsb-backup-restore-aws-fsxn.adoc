This document covers the steps necessary to perform backup and recovery for Microsoft SQL Server on AWS FSx for ONTAP with SnapCenter.  This includes the following information:

* NetApp SnapCenter configuration
* SnapCenter backup operations
* Backup operation for an FCI database
* Backup operation for multiple databases
* Restore and recovery

== SnapCenter Configuration

The following steps must be performed for SnapCenter configuration and the protection of Microsoft SQL Server resources. Each of the following steps is detailed in the following sections.

. Configure sysadmin credentials for the SQL Server backup and restore user.
. Configure storage settings. Provide Amazon Web Services (AWS) management credential to access the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP storage virtual machines (SVMs) from SnapCenter.
. Add a SQL Server host to SnapCenter. Deploy and install the required SnapCenter Plug-ins.
. Configure policies. Define the backup operation type, retention, and optional Snapshot backup replication.
. Configure and protect the Microsoft SQL Server database.

== SnapCenter newly installed user interface

Configure credentials for SQL Server backup and restore the user with sysadmin rights.

NetApp recommends using role-based access control (RBAC) to delegate data protection and management capabilities to individual users across the SnapCenter and window hosts. The user must have access to the SQL Server hosting the database. For multiple hosts,  the username and password must be the same across the various hosts. Furthermore, to enable SnapCenter to deploy the required plug-in on SQL Server hosts,  you must register the domain information for SnapCenter to validate your credentials and hosts.

Expand the following sections to see the detailed instructions on how to complete each step.

.Add the credentials
[%collapsible]
====
Go to *Settings*, select *Credentials*, and click (*+*).
