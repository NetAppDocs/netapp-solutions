The solution provides an overview and details for configuring Oracle Data Guard using Microsoft Azure NetApp Files (ANF) as primary and standby database storage to reduce the licensing and operational cost of the Oracle Data Guard HA/DR solution in the Azure cloud.

== Purpose

Oracle Data Guard ensures high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery for enterprise data in a primary database and standby database replication configuration. Oracle Active Data Guard empowers users to access standby databases while data replication is active from the primary database to standby databases. Data Guard is a feature of Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. It does not require separate licensing. On the other hand, Active Data Guard is an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Option therefore requires separate licensing. Multiple standby databases can receive data replication from a primary database in the Active Data Guard setup. However, each additional standby database requires an Active Data Guard license and extra storage as the size of primary database. The operational costs add up quickly.

If you are keen on cutting back cost of your Oracle database operation and are planning to set up an Active Data Guard in Azure cloud, you should consider an alternative. Instead of Active Data Guard, use Data Guard to replicate from primary database to a single physical standby database on Azure NetApp Files storage. Subsequently, multiple copies of this standby database can be cloned and opened for read/write access to serve many other use cases such as reporting, development, test etc. The net results effectively deliver functionalities of Active Data Guard while eliminating Active Data Guard license. In this documentation, we demonstrate how to setup an Oracle Data Guard with your existing primary database and physical standby database on ANF storage. The standby database is backed up and cloned for read/write access for use cases as desired via NetApp SnapCenter database management tool. NetApp Solutions Engineering team also provides an automation tool kit to refresh clone on user defined schedule for a complete, automated database clone lifecycle management without needs of user intervention.

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Implementation of Oracle Data Guard between a primary database and physical standby database on Microsoft Azure NetApp Files storage across Azure regions.
* Backup and clone the physical standby database to serve use cases such as reporting, dev, test, etc. 
* Oracle database clone refresh lifecycle management via automation.

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who set up Oracle Active Data Guard in Azure cloud for high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery.
* A database solution architect interested in Oracle Active Data Guard configuration in the Azure cloud.
* A storage administrator who manages Azure NetApp Files storage that supports Oracle Data Guard.
* An application owner who like to stand up Oracle Data Guard in Azure cloud environment.

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in an Azure cloud lab setting that might not match the actual user deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key factors for deployment consideration>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *Standby Database Clone.* While receiving and applying transaction logs from primary database, physical standby database can be cloned and mounted on a DB VM to support other workloads such as DEV, TEST, or Report. The clone can be a thin or thick clone. At this moment, ANF only support thick clone, which is a full copy of standby database. The ANF thin clone option will be released shortly. For a thinly cloned copies of database volumes, it shares the same DB volumes of standby database and utilize copy-on-write technology to service write IOs. Thus, the clone are very storage efficient that can be used for many other use cases with minimal and incremental new storage allocation for new write IOs. This provides tremendous storage cost saving by substantially reducing Active Data Guard storage footprint. NetApp recommends to minimize FlexClone activities in the event of database switching over from primary storage to standby ANF storage in order to maintain Oracle performance at high level. 

* *Oracle Software Requirements.* In general, a physical standby database must have the same Database Home version as the primary database including Patch Set Exceptions (PSEs), Critical Patch Updates (CPUs), and Patch Set Updates (PSUs), unless an Oracle Data Guard Standby-First Patch Apply process is in progress (as described in My Oracle Support note 1265700.1 at link:http://support.oracle.com.[support.oracle.com^]

* *Standby Database Directory Structure Considerations.* If possible, the data files, log files, and control files on the primary and standby systems should have the same names and path names and use Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA) naming conventions. The archival directories on the standby database should also be identical between sites, including size and structure. This strategy allows other operations such as backups, switchovers, and failovers to execute the same set of steps, reducing the maintenance complexity. 

* *Force Logging Mode.* To protect against unlogged direct writes in the primary database that cannot be propagated to the standby database, turn on FORCE LOGGING at the primary database before performing data file backups for standby creation. 

* *Azure VM Sizing.* In these tests and validations, we used an Azure VM - Standard_B4ms with 4 vCPUs and16 GiB memory. You need to size the Azure DB VM appropriately for the number of vCPUs and the amount of RAM based on actual workload requirements.

* *Azure NetApp Files Configuration.* Azure NetApp Files are allocated in the Azure NetApp storage account as `Capacity Pools`. In these tests and validations, we deployed a 2 TiB capacity pool to host Oracle primary at the East region and a standby database at the West 2 region. ANF capacity pool has three service levels: Standard, Premium, and Ultra.  The IO capacity of ANF capacity pool is based on the size of the capacity pool and its service level. For production deployment, NetApp recommends taking a full assessment of your Oracle database throughput requirement and sizing the database capacity pool accordingly. At a capacity pool creation, you can set QoS to Auto or Manual and data encryption at rest Single or Double.   


== Solution deployment

It is assumed that you already have your primary Oracle database deployed in AWS EC2 environment within a VPC as the starting point for setting up Data Guard. The primary database is deployed using Oracle ASM for storage management.  Two ASM disk groups - +DATA and +LOGS are created for Oracle data files, log files, and control file etc. For details on Oracle deployment in AWS with ASM, please refer to following technical reports for help. 

* link:aws_ora_fsx_ec2_deploy_intro.html[Oracle Database Deployment on EC2 and FSx Best Practices^]

* link:aws_ora_fsx_ec2_iscsi_asm.html[Oracle Database Deployment and Protection in AWS FSx/EC2 with iSCSI/ASM^]

* link:aws_ora_fsx_ec2_nfs_asm.html[Oracle 19c in Standalone Restart on AWS FSx/EC2 with NFS/ASM^]

Your primary Oracle database can be running either on an FSx ONTAP or any other storage of choices within the AWS EC2 ecosystem. The following section provides step-by-step deployment procedures for setting up Oracle Data Guard between a primary EC2 DB instance with ASM storage to a standby EC2 DB instance with ASM storage.    

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====

Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. An AWS account has been set up, and the necessary VPC and network segments have been created within your AWS account.

. From the AWS EC2 console, you need to deploy minimum three EC2 Linux instances, one as the primary Oracle DB instance, one as standby Oracle DB instance, and an clone target DB instance for reporting, dev, and test etc. See the architecture diagram in the previous section for more details about the environment setup. Also review the AWS link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[User Guide for Linux instances^] for more information.

. From the AWS EC2 console, deploy Amazon FSx ONTAP storage HA clusters to host Oracle volumes that stores the Oracle standby database. If you are not familiar with the deployment of FSx storage, see the documentation link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/creating-file-systems.html[Creating FSx ONTAP file systems^] for step-by-step instructions.

. Steps 2 and 3 can be performed using the following Terraform automation toolkit, which creates an EC2 instance named `ora_01` and an FSx file system named `fsx_01`. Review the instruction carefully and change the variables to suit your environment before execution. The template can be easily revised for your own deployment requirements.
+
[source, cli]
git clone https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_aws_fsx_ec2_deploy.git

[NOTE]

Ensure that you have allocated at least 50G in EC2 instance root volume in order to have sufficient space to stage Oracle installation files.

=== Prepare the primary database for Data Guard
[%collapsible]

====

In this demonstration, we have setup a primary Oracle database called db1 on the primary EC2 DB instance with two ASM disk groups in standalone Restart configuration with data files in ASM disk group +DATA and flash recovery area in ASM disk group +LOGS. Following illustrates the detailed procedures for setting up primary database for Data Guard. All steps should be executed as database owner - oracle user.

. Primary database db1 configuration on primary EC2 DB instance ip-172-30-15-45. The ASM disk groups can be on any type of storage within EC2 ecosystem.

=== Prepare standby database and activate Data Guard
[%collapsible]

====

Oracle Data Guard requires OS kernel configuration and Oracle software stacks including patch sets on standby EC2 DB instance to match with primary EC2 DB instance. For easy management and simplicity, the standby EC2 DB instance database storage configuration ideally should match with the primary EC2 DB instance as well, such as the name, number and size of ASM disk groups. Following are detail procedures for setting up the standby EC2 DB instance for Data Guard. All commands should be executed as oracle owner user id.

. First, review the configuration of the primary database on primary EC2 instance. In this demonstration, we have setup a primary Oracle database called db1 on the primary EC2 DB instance with two ASM disk groups +DATA and +LOGS in standalone Restart configuration. The primary ASM disk groups may be on any type of storage within EC2 ecosystem. 


. Follow procedures in documentation link:aws_ora_fsx_ec2_iscsi_asm.html[TR-4965: Oracle Database Deployment and Protection in AWS FSx/EC2 with iSCSI/ASM^] to install and configure grid and Oracle on standby EC2 DB instance to match with primary database. The database storage should be provisioned and allocated to standby EC2 DB instance from FSx ONTAP with same storage capacity as primary EC2 DB instance.
+
[NOTE]

Stop at step 10 in `Oracle database installation` section. The standby database will be instantiated from primary database using dbca database duplication function. 

. Once Oracle software is installed and configured, from standby $ORACLE_HOME dbs directory, copy oracle password from primary database.
+
[source, cli]
scp oracle@172.30.15.45:/u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/db1/dbs/orapwdb1 .

[source, cli]
alter system set dg_broker_start=true scope=both;

. From primary database, connect to Data Guard Borker as SYSDBA.

=== Clone standby databse for other use cases 
[%collapsible]

====

The key benefit of staging standby database on AWS FSx ONTAP in Data Guard is that it can be FlexCloned to serve many other use cases with minimal additional storage investment. In the following section, we demonstrate how to snapshot and clone the mounted and under recovery standby database volumes on FSx ONTAP for other purposes, such as DEV, TEST, REPORT, etc., using the NetApp SnapCenter tool.

Following are high level procedures to clone a READ/WRITE database from the managed physical standby database in Data Guard using SnapCenter. For detail instructions on how to setup and configure SnapCenter, please refer to link:hybrid_dbops_snapcenter_usecases.html[Hybrid Cloud Database Solutions with SnapCenter^] relavant Oracle sections.

. We begin with creating a test table and inserting a row into the test table on primary database. We will then validate if the transaction traverse down to standby and finally the clone.

[NOTE]

The clone EC2 DB instance should have similar Oracle software stacks installed and configured. In our test case, the grid infrastructure and Oracle 19C installed and configured but no database created. 


. Create a backup policy that is tailored for offline/mount full database backup.

. Select the clone host, which hosts the cloned database from standby DB. Accept the default for data files, control files, and redo logs. Two ASM disk groups will be created on the clone host that are corresponding to the disk groups on standby database.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_data_guard_clone_08.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. No database credentials are needed for OS based authentication. Match Oracle home setting with what is configured on the clone EC2 database instance. 
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_data_guard_clone_09.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Change clone database parameters if needed and specify scripts to run before cloen if any.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_data_guard_clone_10.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Enter SQL to run after clone. In the demo, we executed commands to turn off database archive mode for a dev/test/report database.

. Review the summary, click `Finish` to start the clone.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_data_guard_clone_13.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Monitor clone job in `Monitor` tab. We observed that it took around 8 minutes to clone a database about 300GB in database volume size.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_data_guard_clone_14.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Validate the clone database from SnapCenter, which is immediately registered in `Resources` tab right after clone operation.
+
