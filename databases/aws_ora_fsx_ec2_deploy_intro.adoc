Many mission-critical enterprise Oracle databases are still hosted on-premises, and many enterprises are looking to migrate these Oracle databases to a public cloud. Often, these Oracle databases are application centric and thus require user-specific configurations, a capability that is missing from many database-as-a-service public-cloud offerings. Therefore, the current database landscape calls for a public-cloud-based Oracle database solution built from a high-performance, scalable compute and storage service that can accommodate unique requirements. AWS EC2 compute instances and the AWS FSx storage service might be the missing pieces of this puzzle that you can leverage to build and migrate your mission critical Oracle database workloads to a public cloud.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for enterprises. The simple Amazon EC2 web-service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazonâ€™s proven computing environment.

Amazon FSx for ONTAP is an AWS storage service that uses industry-leading NetApp ONTAP block and file storage, which exposes NFS, SMB, and iSCSI. With such a powerful storage engine, it has never been easier to relocate mission-critical Oracle database apps to AWS with sub-millisecond response times, multiple GBps of throughput, and 100,000+ IOPS per database instance. Better yet, the FSx storage service comes with native replication capability that allows you to easily migrate your on-premises Oracle database to AWS or to replicate your mission critical Oracle database to a secondary AWS availability zone for HA or DR.

The goal of this documentation is to provide step-by-step processes, procedures, and best-practice guidance on how to deploy and configure an Oracle database with FSx storage and an EC2 instance that delivers performance similar to an on-premises system. NetApp also provides an automation toolkit that automates most of the tasks that are required for the deployment, configuration, and management of your Oracle database workload in the AWS public cloud.
