== Purpose

SnapCenter Services is the SaaS version of the classic SnapCenter database management UI tool that is available through the NetApp BlueXP cloud management console. It is an integral part of the NetApp cloud-backup, data-protection offering for databases such as Oracle and HANA running on NetApp cloud storage. This SaaS-based service simplifies traditional SnapCenter standalone server deployment that generally requires a Windows server operating in a Windows domain environment.  

In this documentation, we demonstrate how you can set up SnapCenter Services to backup, restore, and clone Oracle databases deployed to Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage and EC2 compute instances. Although it is much easier to set up and use, SnapCenter Services deliver key functionalities that are available in the legacy SnapCenter UI tool.

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Database backup with snapshots for Oracle databases hosted in Amazon FSx for ONTAP
* Oracle database recovery in the case of a failure  
* Fast and storage-efficient cloning of primary databases for a dev/test environment or other use cases  

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following audiences:

* The DBA who manages Oracle databases running on Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage
* The solution architect who is interested in testing Oracle database backup, restore, and clone in the public AWS cloud
* The storage administrator who supports and manages the Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage
* The application owner who owns applications that are deployed to Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage 

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in an AWS FSx and EC2 environment that might not match the final deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key Factors for Deployment Consideration>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *Connector to be deployed in the same VPC as database and FSx.* When possible, the connector should be deployed in the same AWS VPC, which enables connectivity to the FSx storage and the EC2 compute instance.

* *An AWS IAM policy created for SnapCenter connector.* The policy in JSON format is available in the detailed SnapCenter service documentation. When you launch connector deployment with the BlueXP console, you are also prompted to set up the prerequisites with details of required permission in JSON format. The policy should be assigned to the AWS user account that owns the connector.

* *The AWS account access key and the SSH key pair created in the AWS account.* The SSH key pair is assigned to the ec2-user for logging into the connector host and then deploying a database plug-in to the EC2 DB server host. The access key grants permission for provisioning the required connector with IAM policy above.

* *A credential added to the BlueXP console setting.* To add Amazon FSx for ONTAP to the BlueXP working environment, a credential that grants BlueXP permissions to access Amazon FSx for ONTAP is set up in the BlueXP console setting. 

* *java-11-openjdk installed on the EC2 database instance host.* SnapCenter service installation requires java version 11. It needs to be installed on application host before plugin deployment attempt.

== Solution deployment

There is extensive NetApp documentation with a broader scope to help you protect your cloud-native application data. The goal of this documentation is to provide step-by-step procedures that cover SnapCenter Service deployment with the BlueXP console to protect your Oracle database deployed to Amazon FSx for ONTAP and an EC2 compute instance. This document fills in certain details that might be missing from more general instructions.

To get started, complete the following steps:

* Read the general instructions link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-backup-restore/concept-protect-cloud-app-data-to-cloud.html#architecture[Protect your cloud native applications data^] and the sections related to Oracle and Amazon FSx for ONTAP.

* Watch the following video walkthrough.

=== Prerequisites for SnapCenter service deployment

[%collapsible]
====
Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. A primary Oracle database server on an EC2 instance with an Oracle database fully deployed and running. 

. An Amazon FSx for ONTAP cluster deployed in AWS that is hosting the database volumes above.

. An optional database server on an EC2 instance that can be used for testing the cloning of an Oracle database to an alternate host for the purpose of supporting a dev/test workload or any use cases that requires a full data set of a production Oracle database.

. If you need help to meet the above prerequisites for Oracle database deployment on Amazon FSx for ONTAP and EC2 compute instance, see link:aws_ora_fsx_ec2_iscsi_asm.html[Oracle Database Deployment and Protection in AWS FSx/EC2 with iSCSI/ASM^] or white paper link:aws_ora_fsx_ec2_deploy_intro.html[Oracle Database Deployment on EC2 and FSx Best Practices^]
====

=== Onboarding to BlueXP preparation

[%collapsible]
====
. Use the link link:https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/[NetApp BlueXP] to sign up for BlueXP console access.

. Login to your AWS account to create an IAM policy with proper permissions and assign the policy to the AWS account that will be used for BlueXP connector deployment.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_01-policy.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]
+
The policy should be configured with a JSON string that is available in NetApp documentation. The JSON string can also be retrieved from the page when connector provisioning is launched and you are prompted for the prerequisites permissions assignment.

. You also need the AWS VPC, subnet, security group, an AWS user account access key and secrets, an SSH key for ec2-user, and so on ready for connector provisioning. 
====

=== Deploy a connector for SnapCenter services

[%collapsible]
====
. Login to the BlueXP console. For a shared account, it is a best practice to create an individual workspace by clicking *Account* > *Manage Account* > *Workspace* to add a new workspace.

. Click the three dots next to the database *Protection Status*, and then click *Polices* to view the default preloaded database protection policies that can be applied to protect your Oracle databases.

image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_01.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. You can also create your own policy with a customized backup frequency and backup data-retention window.

image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_02.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. When you are happy with the policy configuration, you can then assign your policy of choice to protect the database.

image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_03.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Choose the policy to assign to the database.

image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_04.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. After the policy is applied, the database protection status changed to *Protected* with a green check mark.

image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_05.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. The database backup runs on a predefined schedule. You can also run a one-off on-demand backup as shown below.

image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_06.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. The database backups details can be viewed by clicking *View Details* from the menu list. This includes the backup name, backup type, SCN, and backup date. A backup set covers a snapshot for both data volume and log volume. A log volume snapshot takes place right after a database volume snapshot. You can apply a filter if you are looking for a particular backup in a long list.

image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_07.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]
====

=== Oracle database restore and recovery
