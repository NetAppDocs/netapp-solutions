== Purpose

SnapCenter Services is the SaaS version of the classic SnapCenter database management UI tool that is available through the NetApp BlueXP cloud management console. It is an integral part of the NetApp cloud-backup, data-protection offering for databases such as Oracle and HANA running on NetApp cloud storage. This SaaS-based service simplifies traditional SnapCenter standalone server deployment that generally requires a Windows server operating in a Windows domain environment.  

In this documentation, we demonstrate how you can set up SnapCenter Services to backup, restore, and clone Oracle databases deployed to Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage and EC2 compute instances. Although it is much easier to set up and use, SnapCenter Services deliver key functionalities that are available in the legacy SnapCenter UI tool.

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Database backup with snapshots for Oracle databases hosted in Amazon FSx for ONTAP
* Oracle database recovery in the case of a failure  
* Fast and storage-efficient cloning of primary databases for a dev/test environment or other use cases  

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following audiences:

* The DBA who manages Oracle databases running on Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage
* The solution architect who is interested in testing Oracle database backup, restore, and clone in the public AWS cloud
* The storage administrator who supports and manages the Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage
* The application owner who owns applications that are deployed to Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage 

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in an AWS FSx and EC2 environment that might not match the final deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key Factors for Deployment Consideration>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *Connector to be deployed in the same VPC as database and FSx.* When possible, the connector should be deployed in the same AWS VPC, which enables connectivity to the FSx storage and the EC2 compute instance.

* *An AWS IAM policy created for SnapCenter connector.* The policy in JSON format is available in the detailed SnapCenter service documentation. When you launch connector deployment with the BlueXP console, you are prompted to set up the prerequisites. The policy should be assigned to the AWS user account that owns the connector.

* *The AWS account access key and the SSH key pair created in the AWS account.* The SSH key pair is assigned to the ec2-user for logging into the connector host and then deploying a database plug-in to the EC2 DB server host. The access key grants permission for provisioning the required connector.

* *A credential added to the BlueXP console setting.* To add Amazon FSx for ONTAP to the BlueXP working environment, a credential that grants permissions to access Amazon FSx for ONTAP from the BlueXP console is set up in the BlueXP console setting. 

* *SnapCenter plug-in deployed to the EC2 database instance host.* SnapCenter services make API calls that are executed by the SnapCenter plug-in on the EC2 database instance host. You must deploy it before setting up the services.

== Solution deployment

There is extensive NetApp documentation with a broader scope to help you protect your cloud-native application data. The goal of this documentation is to provide step-by-step procedures that cover SnapCenter Service deployment with the BlueXP console to protect your Oracle database deployed to Amazon FSx for ONTAP and an EC2 compute instance. This document fills in certain details that might be missing from more general instructions.

To get started, complete the following steps:

* Read the general instructions link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-backup-restore/concept-protect-cloud-app-data-to-cloud.html#architecture[Protect your cloud native applications data^] and the sections related to Oracle and Amazon FSx for ONTAP.

* Watch the following video walkthrough.

=== Prerequisites for SnapCenter service deployment
[%collapsible]

====
Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. A primary Oracle database server on an EC2 instance with an Oracle database fully deployed and running. 

. A Amazon FSx for ONTAP cluster deployed in AWS that is hosting the database above.
. An optional database server on an EC2 instance that can be used for testing the cloning of an Oracle database to an alternative host for the purpose of supporting a dev/test workload or any use cases that requires a full data set of production Oracle database.

. If you need help to meet the above prerequisites for Oracle database deployment on Amazon FSx for ONTAP and EC2 compute instance, see link:aws_ora_fsx_ec2_iscsi_asm.html[Oracle Database Deployment and Protection in AWS FSx/EC2 with iSCSI/ASM^].

====

=== Onboarding to BlueXP preparation
[%collapsible]

====

. Use the link link:https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/[NetApp BlueXP] to sign up for BlueXP console access.

. To set up BlueXP to manage AWS cloud resources such as Amazon FSx for ONTAP, you should already have an AWS account set up. You can then log into your AWS account to create an IAM policy for granting SnapCenter service access to an AWS account to use for connector deployment.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_01-policy.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]
+
The policy should be configured with a JSON string that is available when connector provisioning is launched and you are prompted as a reminder that an IAM policy has been created and granted to an AWS account that is used for connector deployment. 

. You also need the AWS VPC, a key and secrets for your AWS account, an SSH key for EC2 access, a security group, and so on ready for connector provisioning. 

====

=== Deploy a connector for SnapCenter services
[%collapsible]

====
. Log into the BlueXP console. For a shared account, it is a best practice to create an individual workspace by clicking *Account* > *Manage Account* > *Workspace* to add a new workspace.
+ 
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_02-wspace.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Click *Add a Connector* to launch the connector provisioning workflow.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_03-add.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Choose your cloud provider (in this case, *Amazon Web Services*).
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_04-aws.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Skip the *Permission*, *Authentication*, and *Networking* steps if you already have them set up in your AWS account. If not, you must configure these before proceeding. From here, you could also retrieve the permissions for the AWS policy that is referenced in the previous section "<<Onboarding to BlueXP preparation>>." 
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_05-remind.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Enter your AWS account authentication access key and secret key.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_06-auth.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Name the connector instance and select *Create Role* under *Details*.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_07-details.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Configure networking with the proper VPC, subnet, and SSH key pair for EC2 access.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_08-network.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Set the security group for the connector.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_09-security.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Review the summary page and click *Add* to start connector creation. It generally takes about 10 mins to complete deployment. Once completed, the connector instance appears in the AWS EC2 dashboard.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_connector_10-review.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. After the connector is deployed, log into the connector EC2 host as the ec2-user with an SSH key to install the SnapCenter plug-in following these instructions: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-backup-restore/task-add-host-discover-oracle-databases.html#deploy-the-plug-in-using-script-and-add-host-from-ui-using-manual-option[Deploy the plug-in using script and add host from UI using manual option^].

====
=== SnapCenter services setup
[%collapsible]

====

With the connector deployed, SnapCenter services can now be set up with the following procedure:

. From *My Working Environment* click *Add working Environment* to discover FSx deployed in AWS.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_01.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Choose *Amazon Web Services* as the location.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_02.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Click *Discover Existing* next to *Amazon FSx for ONTAP*.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_03.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Select the credentials that provides BlueXP with the permissions that it needs to manage FSx for ONTAP. If you have not added credentials, you can add it from the *Settings* menu at the top right corner of the BlueXP console.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_04.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Choose the AWS region where Amazon FSx for ONTAP is deployed, select the FSx cluster that is hosting the Oracle database and click Add.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_05.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. The discovered Amazon FSx for ONTAP instance now appears in the working environment.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_06.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. You can log into the FSx cluster with your fsxadmin account credentials.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_07.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. After you log into Amazon FSx for ONTAP, review your database storage information (such as database volumes). 
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_08.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. From the left-hand sidebar of the console, hover your mouse over the protection icon, and then click *Protection* > *Applications* to open the Applications launch page. Click *Discover Applications*.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_09.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Select *Cloud Native* as the application source type.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_10.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Choose *Oracle* for the application type.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_13.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Provide the Oracle EC2 instance host details to add a host. Check the box to confirm that the plug-in for Oracle on the host has been installed, because you deploy the plug-in after the connector is provisioned.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_16.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Discover the Oracle EC2 host and add it to *Applications*, and any databases on the host are discovered and displayed on the page as well. The database *Protection Status* shows as *Unprotected*.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_setup_17.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

This completes the initial setup of SnapCenter services for Oracle. The next three sections of this document describe Oracle database backup, restore, and clone operations.

====

=== Oracle database backup
[%collapsible]

====

. Click the three dots next to the database *Protection Status*, and then click *Polices* to view the default preloaded database protection policies that can be applied to protect your Oracle databases.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_01.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. You can also create your own policy with a customized backup frequency and backup data-retention window.
+ 
image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_02.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. When you are happy with the policy configuration, you can then assign your policy of choice to protect the database.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_03.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Choose the policy to assign to the database.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_04.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. After the policy is applied, the database protection status changed to *Protected* with a green check mark.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_05.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. The database backup runs on a predefined schedule. You can also run a one-off on-demand backup as shown below.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_06.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. The database backups details can be viewed by clicking *View Details* from the menu list. This includes the backup name, backup type, SCN, and backup date. A backup set covers a snapshot for both data volume and log volume. A log volume snapshot takes place right after a database volume snapshot. You can apply a filter if you are looking for a particular backup in a long list.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_bkup_07.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

====

=== Oracle database restore and recovery
[%collapsible]

====

. For a database restore, choose the right backup, either by the SCN or backup time. Click the three dots from the database data backup, and then click *Restore* to initiate database restore and recovery. 
+
image:snapctr_svcs_restore_01.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Choose your restore setting. If you are sure that nothing has changed in the physical database structure after the backup (such as the addition of a data file or a disk group), you can use the *Force in place restore* option, which is generally faster. Otherwise, do not check this box.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_restore_02.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Review and start database restore and recovery.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_restore_03.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. From the *Job Monitoring* tab, you can view the status of the restore job as well as any details while it is running.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_restore_05.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]
+
image:snapctr_svcs_restore_04.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

====

=== Oracle database clone 
[%collapsible]

====

To clone a database, launch the clone workflow from the same database backup details page.

. Select the right database backup copy, click the three dots to view the menu, and choose the *Clone* option.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_clone_02.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Select the *Basic* option if you don't need to change any cloned database parameters. 
+
image:snapctr_svcs_clone_03.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Alternatively, select *Specification file*, which gives you the option of downloading the current init file, making changes, and then uploading it back to the job.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_clone_03_1.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Review and launch the job.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_clone_04.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Monitor the cloning job status from the *Job Monitoring* tab.
+
image:snapctr_svcs_clone_07-status.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Validate the cloned database on the EC2 instance host.
