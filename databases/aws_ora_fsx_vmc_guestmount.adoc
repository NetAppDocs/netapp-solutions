This solution provides overview and details for Oracle deployment and protection in VMware Cloud in AWS with FSx ONTAP as primary database storage and Oracle database configured in standalone ReStart using asm as volume manager.

== Purpose

Enterprises have been running Oracle on VMware in private data centers for decades. VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS  provides a push-button solution to bring VMware’s enterprise-class Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) software to the AWS Cloud’s dedicated, elastic, bare-metal infrastructure. AWS FSx ONTAP offers premium storage to VMC SDDC and a data fabric that enables customers to run business-critical applications such as Oracle across vSphere®-based private, public, and hybrid cloud environments, with optimized access to AWS services. Whether it is an existing or new Oracle workload, VMC on AWS provides a familiar, simplified, and self-managed Oracle environment on VMware with all the benefits of AWS cloud while deferring all platform management and optimization to VMware.  

This documentation demonstrates the deployment and protection of an Oracle database in a VMC environment with Amazon FSx ONTAP as primary database storage. Oracle database can be deployed to VMC on FSx storage as direct VM guest-mounted LUNs or NFS-mounted VMware VMDK datastore disks. This technical report focuses on Oracle database deployment as direct guest-mounted FSx storage to VMs in the VMC cluster with the iSCSI protocol and Oracle ASM. We also demonstrate how to use the NetApp SnapCenter UI tool to backup, restore, and clone an Oracle database for dev/test or other use cases for storage-efficient database operation in the VMC on AWS. 


This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Oracle database deployment in VMC on AWS with Amazon FSx ONTAP as primary database storage 
* Oracle database backup and restore in VMC on AWS using NetApp SnapCenter tool 
* Oracle database clone for dev/test or other use cases in VMC on AWS using NetApp SnapCenter tool

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who would like to deploy Oracle in VMC on AWS with Amazon FSx ONTAP
* A database solution architect who would like to test Oracle workloads in VMC on the AWS cloud
* A storage administrator who would like to deploy and manage an Oracle database deployed to VMC on AWS with Amazon FSx ONTAP
* An application owner who would like to stand up an Oracle database in VMC on the AWS cloud

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in a lab environment with VMC on AWS that might not match the final deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key factors for deployment considerations>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *FSx to VMC connectivity.* When you deploy your SDDC on VMware Cloud on AWS, it is created within an AWS account and a VPC dedicated to your organization and managed by VMware. You must also connect the SDDC to an AWS account belonging to you, called the customer AWS account. This connection allows your SDDC to access AWS services belonging to your customer account. FSx for ONTAP is an AWS service deployed in your customer account. Once the VMC SDDC is connected to your customer account, FSx storage is available to VMs in VMC SDDC for direct guest mount. 

* *FSx storage HA clusters single- or multi-zone deployment.* In these tests and validations, we deployed an FSx HA cluster in a single AWS availability zone. NetApp also recommends deploying FSx for NetApp ONTAP and VMware Cloud on AWS in the same availability zone to achieve better performance and avoid data transfer charges between availability zones.

* *FSx storage cluster sizing.* An Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage file system provides up to 160,000 raw SSD IOPS, up to 4GBps throughput, and a maximum of 192TiB capacity. However, you can size the cluster in terms of provisioned IOPS, throughput, and storage limit (minimum 1,024 GiB) based on your actual requirements at the time of deployment. The capacity can be adjusted dynamically on the fly without affecting application availability.   

* *Oracle data and logs layout.* In our tests and validations, we deployed two ASM disk groups for data and logs respectively. Within the +DATA asm disk group, we provisioned four LUNs in a data volume. Within the +LOGS asm disk group, we provisioned two LUNs in a log volume. In general, multiple LUNs laid out within an Amazon FSx for ONTAP volume provide better performance. 

* *iSCSI configuration.* The database VMs in VMC SDDC connect to FSx storage with the iSCSI protocol. It is important to gauge the Oracle database peak I/O throughput requirement by carefully analyzing the Oracle AWR report to determine the application and iSCSI traffic-throughput requirements. NetApp also recommends allocating four iSCSI connections to both FSx iSCSI endpoints with multipath properly configured.

* *Oracle ASM redundancy level to use for each Oracle ASM disk group that you create.* Because FSx ONTAP already mirrors the storage on the FSx cluster level, you should use External Redundancy, which means that the option does not allow Oracle ASM to mirror the contents of the disk group.

* *Database backup.* NetApp provides a SnapCenter software suite for database backup, restore, and cloning with a user-friendly UI interface. NetApp recommends implementing such a management tool to achieve fast (under a minute) SnapShot backup, quick (minutes) database restore, and database clone.    

== Solution deployment

The following sections provide step-by-step procedures for Oracle 19c deployment in VMC on AWS with directly mounted FSx ONTAP storage to DB VM in a single node Restart configuration with Oracle ASM as database volume manager.     

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====

Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. A software-defined data center (SDDC) using VMware Cloud on AWS has been created. For detailed instruction on how to create an SDDC in VMC, please refer to VMware documentation link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/com.vmware.vmc-aws.getting-started/GUID-3D741363-F66A-4CF9-80EA-AA2866D1834E.html[Getting Started With VMware Cloud on AWS^]

. An AWS account has been set up, and the necessary VPC and network segments have been created within your AWS account. The AWS account is linked to your VMC SDDC.

. From the AWS EC2 console, deploying an Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage HA clusters to host the Oracle database volumes. If you are not familiar with the deployment of FSx storage, see the documentation link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/creating-file-systems.html[Creating FSx for ONTAP file systems^] for step-by-step instructions.

. The above step can be performed using the following Terraform automation toolkit, which creates an EC2 instance as a jump host for SDDC in VMC access via SSH and an FSx file system. Review instructions carefully and change the variables to suit your environment before execution.
+
....
git clone https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_aws_fsx_ec2_deploy.git
....

. Build VMs in VMware SDDC on AWS for hosting your Oracle environment to be deployed in VMC. In our demonstration, we have built two Linux VMs as Oracle DB servers, one Windows server for the SnapCenter server, and one optional Linux server as an Ansible controller for automated Oracle installation or configuration if desired. Following is a snapshot of the lab environment for the solution validation.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_vm_08.png["Screenshot showing VMC SDDC test environment."]


. Optionally, NetApp also provides several automation toolkits to run Oracle deployment and configuration when applicable. Refer to link:index.html[DB Automation Toolkits^] for more information.

[NOTE]

Ensure that you have allocated at least 50G in Oracle VM root volume in order to have sufficient space to stage Oracle installation files.

====

=== DB VM kernel configuration
[%collapsible]

====

With the prerequisites provisioned, login to the Oracle VM as an admin user via SSH and sudo to the root user to configure the Linux kernel for Oracle installation. Oracle install files can be staged in an AWS S3 bucket and transferred into the VM.

=== Oracle backup, restore, and clone with SnapCenter
[%collapsible]

==== SnapCenter Setup
[%collapsible]

=====

SnapCenter relies on a host-side plug-in on database VM to perform application-aware data protection management activities. For detailed information on NetApp SnapCenter plugin for Oracle, refer to this documentation link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-sco/concept_what_you_can_do_with_the_snapcenter_plug_in_for_oracle_database.html[What can you do with the Plug-in for Oracle Database^]. The following provides high level steps to setup SnapCenter for Oracle database backup, recovery, and clone. 

. Download the latest version of SnapCenter software from NetApp support site: link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/downloads[NetApp Support Downloads^].

. As administrator, install latest java JDK from link:https://www.java.com/en/[Get Java for desktop applications^] on SnapCenter server Windows host.
+
[NOTE]

If Windows server is deployed in a domain environment, add a domain user to SnapCenter server local administrators group and run SnapCenter installation with the domain user. 

. Login to SnapCenter UI via HTTPS port 8846 as installation user to configure SnapCenter for Oracle.

. Update `Hypervisor Settings` in global settings.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_01.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Create Oracle database backup policies. Ideally, create a separate archive log backup policy to allow more frequent backup interval to minimize data loss in the event of a failure.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_02.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Add database server `Credential` for SnapCenter access to DB VM. The credential should have sudo privilege on a Linux VM or administrator privilege on a Windows VM. 
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_03.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Add FSx ONTAP storage cluster to `Storage Systems` with cluster management IP and authenticated via fsxadmin user ID. 
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_04.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Add Oracle database VM in VMC to `Hosts` with server credential created in previous step 6.  
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_05.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

[NOTE]

Ensure that the SnapCenter server name can be resolved to the IP address from the DB VM and DB VM name can be resolved to the IP address from the SnapCenter server.  

=====

==== Database backup
[%collapsible]

=====

SnapCenter leverages FSx ONTAP volume snapshot for much quicker database backup, restore, or clone compared with traditional RMAN based methodology. The snapshots are application-consistent as the database is put in Oracle backup mode before a snapshot. 

. From the `Resources` tab, any databases on the VM are auto-discovered after the VM is added to SnapCenter. Initially, the database status shows as `Not protected`.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_06.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Create a resources group to backup the database in a logical grouping such as by DB VM etc. In this example, we created an ora_02_data group to do a full online database backup for all databases on VM ora_02. Resources group ora_02_log performs the backup of archived logs only on the VM. Creating a resources group also defines a schedule to execute the backup.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_07.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Resources group backup can also be triggered manually by clicking on `Back up Now` and executing the backup with the policy defined in the resources group.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_08.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. The backup job can be monitored at the `Monitor` tab by clicking on the running job.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_09.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. After a successful backup, the database status shows the job status and the most recent backup time. 
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_10.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Click on database to review the backup sets for each database. 
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_11.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

=====

==== Database recovery
[%collapsible]

=====

SnapCenter provides a number of restore and recovery options for Oracle databases from snapshot backup. In this example, we demonstrate a point in time restoration to recover a dropped table by mistake. On VM ora_02, two databases cdb3, cdb4 share the same +DATA and +LOGS disk groups. Database restoration for one database does not impact the availability of the other database. 

. First, create a test table and insert a row into table to validate a point in time recovery.

=====

In this example, the same backup sets is used to clone a database on the same VM in a different ORACLE_HOME. The procedures are equally applicable to clone a database from the backup to separate VM in VMC if needed.

. Open the database cdb3 backup list. From a data backup of choice, click on `Clone` button to launch database clone workflow.

. Name the clone database SID.
+

. Select a VM in VMC as the target database host. Identical Oracle version should have been installed and configured on the host.
+

. Change clone database parameters to meet configuration or resources requirements for the clone database.
+

. Choose recovery scope. `Until Cancel` recovers the clone up to last available log file in the backup set.
