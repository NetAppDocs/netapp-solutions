== Purpose

Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a storage service that allows you to launch and run fully managed NetApp ONTAP file systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides the familiar features, performance, capabilities, and APIs of NetApp file systems with the agility, scalability, and simplicity of a fully managed AWS service. It empowers you to run the most demanding database workload, such as Oracle, in the AWS cloud with peace of mind.  

This documentation demonstrates the simplified deployment of Oracle databases in an Amazon FSx ONTAP file system using Ansible automation. The Oracle database is deployed in a standalone ReStart configuration with iSCSI protocol for data access and Oracle ASM for database storage disks management. It also provides information on Oracle database backup, restore, and clone using the NetApp SnapCenter UI tool for storage-efficient database operation in AWS Cloud. 


This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Automated Oracle database deployment on Amazon FSx ONTAP file system  
* Oracle database backup and restore on Amazon FSx ONTAP file system using NetApp SnapCenter tool 
* Oracle database clone for dev/test or other use cases on Amazon FSx ONTAP file system using NetApp SnapCenter tool

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who would like to deploy Oracle on Amazon FSx ONTAP file system.
* A database solution architect who would like to test Oracle workloads on Amazon FSx ONTAP file system.
* A storage administrator who would like to deploy and manage an Oracle database on Amazon FSx ONTAP file system.
* An application owner who would like to stand up an Oracle database on Amazon FSx ONTAP file system.

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution were performed in a lab setting that might not match the final deployment environment. See the section <<Key Factors for Deployment Consideration>> for more information.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *Oracle database storage layout.* In this automated Oracle deployment, we provision four database volumes to host Oracle binary, data, and logs by default. A single lun in a volume allocates to Oracle binary. We then create two ASM disk groups from data and logs luns. Within the +DATA asm disk group, we provision two data volumes with two luns in a volume. Within the +LOGS asm disk group, we create two luns in a log volume. Multiple luns laid out within an ONTAP volume provides better performance in general. 

* *Multiple DB servers deployment.* The automation solution can deploy an Oracle container database to multiple DB servers in a single Ansible playbook run. Regardless of the number of DB servers, the playbook execution remains the same. You can deploy multiple container databases to a single EC2 instance with different database instance IDs (Oracle SID). But ensure there is sufficient memory on the host to support deployed databases.  

* *iSCSI configuration.* The EC2 instance database server connects to FSx storage with the iSCSI protocol. EC2 instances generally deploy with a single network interface or ENI. The single NIC interface carries both iSCSI and application traffic. It is important to gauge the Oracle database peak I/O throughput requirement by carefully analyzing the Oracle AWR report in order to choose the right EC2 compute instance that meets both application and iSCSI traffic-throughput requirements. NetApp also recommends allocating four iSCSI connections to both FSx iSCSI endpoints with multipath properly configured.

* *Oracle ASM redundancy level to use for each Oracle ASM disk group that you create.* Because the Amazon FSx ONTAP is HA enabled for data protection at the cluster disk level, you should use `External Redundancy`, which means that the option does not allow Oracle ASM to mirror the contents of the disk group.

* *Database backup.* NetApp provides a SnapCenter software suite for database backup, restore, and cloning with a user-friendly UI interface. NetApp recommends implementing such a management tool to achieve fast (under a minute) SnapShot backup, quick (minutes) database restore, and database clone.    

== Solution deployment

The following sections provide step-by-step procedures for automated Oracle 19c deployment and protection on Amazon FSx ONTAP file system with directly mounted database luns via iSCSI to EC2 instance VM in a single node Restart configuration with Oracle ASM as database volume manager.     

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====

Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. An AWS account has been set up, and the necessary VPC and network segments have been created within your AWS account.

. From the AWS EC2 console, deploy EC2 Linux instances as Oracle DB servers. Enable SSH private/public key authentication for ec2-user. See the architecture diagram in the previous section for details about the environment setup. Also review the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[User Guide for Linux instances^] for more information.

. From the AWS FSx console, provision an Amazon FSx ONTAP file system that meets the requirements. Review the documentation link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/creating-file-systems.html[Creating FSx for ONTAP file systems^] for step-by-step instructions.

. Steps 2 and 3 can be performed using the following Terraform automation toolkit, which creates an EC2 instance named `ora_01` and an FSx file system named `fsx_01`. Review the instruction carefully and change the variables to suit your environment before execution. The template can be easily revised for your own deployment requirements.
+
[source, cli]
git clone https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_aws_fsx_ec2_deploy.git

. Provision an EC2 Linux instance as the Ansible controller node with the latest version of Ansible and Git installed. Refer to the following link for details: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/automation/getting-started.html[Getting Started with NetApp solution automation^] in section - 
`Setup the Ansible Control Node for CLI deployments on RHEL / CentOS` or 
`Setup the Ansible Control Node for CLI deployments on Ubuntu / Debian`. 

. Provision a Windows server to run the NetApp SnapCenter UI tool with the latest version. Refer to the following link for details: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/install/task_install_the_snapcenter_server_using_the_install_wizard.html[Install the SnapCenter Server^]

. Clone a copy of the NetApp Oracle deployment automation toolkit for iSCSI. 
+
[source, cli]
git clone https://bitbucket.ngage.netapp.com/scm/ns-bb/na_oracle_deploy_iscsi.git

. Stage following Oracle 19c installation files on EC2 instances /tmp/archive directory.
+
      installer_archives:
        - "LINUX.X64_193000_grid_home.zip"
        - "p34762026_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"
        - "LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip"
        - "p34765931_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"
        - "p6880880_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"
+
[NOTE]

Ensure that you have allocated at least 50G in Oracle VM root volume to have sufficient space to stage Oracle installation files.

. Watch the following video:

=== Automation parameter files
[%collapsible]

====

Ansible playbook executes database installation and configuration tasks with predefined parameters. For this Oracle automation solution, there are three user-defined parameter files that need user input before playbook execution.

* hosts - define targets that the automation playbook is running against.
* vars/vars.yml - the global variable file that defines variables that apply to all targets.
* host_vars/host_name.yml - the local variable file that defines variables that apply only to a named target. In our use case, these are the Oracle DB servers. 

In addition to these user-defined variable files, there are several default variable files that contain default parameters that do not require change unless necessary. The following sections show how to configure the user-defined variable files.  

====

=== Parameter files configuration
[%collapsible]

====

. Ansible target `hosts` file configuration:
+
include::../_include/automation_ora_aws-fsx_iscsi_hosts.adoc[]

. Global `vars/vars.yml` file configuration
+
include::../_include/automation_ora_aws-fsx_iscsi_vars.adoc[]

. Local DB server `host_vars/host_name.yml` configuration such as ora_01.yml, ora_02.yml ...
+
include::../_include/automation_ora_asa_iscsi_host_vars.adoc[]

====

=== Playbook execution
[%collapsible]

====

There are a total of five playbooks in the automation toolkit. Each performs different task blocks and serves different purposes.

      0-all_playbook.yml - execute playbooks from 1-4 in one playbook run.
      1-ansible_requirements.yml - set up Ansible controller with required libs and collections.
      2-linux_config.yml - execute Linux kernel configuration on Oracle DB servers.
      3-ontap_config.yml - configure ONTAP svm/volumes/luns for Oracle database and grant DB server access to luns.  
      4-oracle_config.yml - install and configure Oracle on DB servers for grid infrastructure and create a container database. 
      5-destroy.yml - optional to undo the environment to dismantle all. 

There are three options to run the playbooks with the following commands. 

. Execute all playbooks in one combined run.
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml

. Execute playbooks one at a time with the number sequence from 1-4.
+
[source, cli]] 
ansible-playbook -i hosts 1-ansible_requirements.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml
+
[source, cli] 
ansible-playbook -i hosts 2-linux_config.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 3-ontap_config.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 4-oracle_config.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml

. Execute 0-all_playbook.yml with a tag.
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml -t ansible_requirements
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml -t linux_config
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml -t ontap_config
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml -t oracle_config

. Undo the environment
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 5-destroy.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/vars.yml
