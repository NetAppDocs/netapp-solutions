== Purpose

Running performance-intensive and latency-sensitive Oracle workloads in the cloud can be challenging. Azure NetApp Files (ANF) makes it easy for enterprise line-of-business (LOB) and storage professionals to migrate and run demanding Oracle workloads without code change. Azure NetApp Files is widely used as the underlying shared file-storage service in various scenarios, such as new deployment or migration (lift and shift) of Oracle databases from on-premises to Azure.

This documentation demonstrates the simplified deployment of Oracle databases in Azure NetApp files via NFS mounts using Ansible automation. The Oracle database deploys in a container database (CDB) and pluggable databases (PDB) configuration with Oracle dNFS protocol enabled to boost performance. Furthermore, the on-premises Oracle single instance database or PDB can be migrated into a newly deployed container database in Azure using automated PDB relocation methodology with minimal service interruption. It also provides information on fast Oracle database backup, restore, and clone with NetApp SnapCenter UI tool in Azure Cloud. 


This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Automated Oracle container database deployment on Azure NetApp files  
* Automated Oracle database migration between on-premisses and Azure cloud 

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who would like to deploy Oracle on Azure NetApp Files.
* A database solution architect who would like to test Oracle workloads on Azure NetApp Files.
* A storage administrator who would like to deploy and manage an Oracle database on Azure NetApp Files.
* An application owner who would like to stand up an Oracle database on Azure NetApp Files.

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution were performed in a lab setting that might not match the final deployment environment. See the section <<Key Factors for Deployment Consideration>> for more information.

|===

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *Oracle database storage layout.* In this automated Oracle deployment, we provision three database volumes for each database to host Oracle binary, data, and logs by default. The volumes are mounted on Oracle DB server as /u01 - binary, /u02 - data, /u03 - logs via NFS. Dual control files are configured on /u02 and /u03 mount points for redundancy. 

* *Multiple DB servers deployment.* The automation solution can deploy an Oracle container database to multiple DB servers in a single Ansible playbook run. Regardless of the number of DB servers, the playbook execution remains the same. You can deploy multiple container databases to a single VM instance by repeating the deployment with different database instance IDs (Oracle SID). But ensure there is sufficient memory on the host to support deployed databases.  

* *dNFS configuration.* By using dNFS (available since Oracle 11g), an Oracle database running on an Azure Virtual Machine can drive significantly more I/O than the native NFS client. Automated Oracle deployment configures dNFS on NFSv3 by default.

* *Allocate large size volume to speed up deployment.* ANF file system IO throughput is regulated based on the size of volume. For initial deployment, allocate large size volumes can speed up the deployment. The volumes subsequently can be downsized dynamically without application impact.

* *Database backup.* NetApp provides a SnapCenter software suite for database backup, restore, and cloning with a user-friendly UI interface. NetApp recommends implementing such a management tool to achieve fast (under a minute) snapshot backup, quick (minutes) database restore, and database clone.    

== Solution deployment

The following sections provide step-by-step procedures for automated Oracle 19c deployment and database migration on Azure NetApp Files with directly mounted database volumes via NFS to Azure VMs.     

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====

Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. An Azure account has been set up, and the necessary VNet and network segments have been created within your Azure account.

. From the Azure cloud portal, deploy Azure Linux VMs as Oracle DB servers. Create an Azure NetApp Files capacity pool and database volumes for Oracle database. Enable VM SSH private/public key authentication for azureuser to DB servers. See the architecture diagram in the previous section for details about the environment setup. Also referred to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/databases/azure_ora_nfile_procedures.html[Step-by-Step Oracle deployment procedures on Azure VM and Azure NetApp Files^] for detailed information.
+
[NOTE]

For Azure VMs deployed with local disk redundancy, ensure that you have allocated at least 128G in the VM root disk to have sufficient space to stage Oracle installation files and add OS swap file. Expand /tmplv and /rootlv OS partition accordingly. Ensure the database volume naming follows the VMname-u01, VMname-u02, and VMname-u03 convention.
+
[source, cli]
sudo lvresize -r -L +20G /dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv
+
[source, cli]
sudo lvresize -r -L +10G /dev/mapper/rootvg-tmplv

. From the Azure cloud portal, provision a Windows server to run the NetApp SnapCenter UI tool with the latest version. Refer to the following link for details: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/install/task_install_the_snapcenter_server_using_the_install_wizard.html[Install the SnapCenter Server^]

. Provision a Linux VM as the Ansible controller node with the latest version of Ansible and Git installed. Refer to the following link for details: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/automation/getting-started.html[Getting Started with NetApp solution automation^] in section - 
`Setup the Ansible Control Node for CLI deployments on RHEL / CentOS` or 
`Setup the Ansible Control Node for CLI deployments on Ubuntu / Debian`. 
+
[NOTE]

The Ansible controller node can locate either on-premisses or in Azure cloud as far as it can reach Azure DB VMs via ssh port.  

. Clone a copy of the NetApp Oracle deployment automation toolkit for NFS. 
+
[source, cli]
git clone https://bitbucket.ngage.netapp.com/scm/ns-bb/na_oracle_deploy_nfs.git

. Stage following Oracle 19c installation files on Azure DB VM /tmp/archive directory with 777 permission.
+
      installer_archives:
        - "LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip"
        - "p34765931_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"

====

=== Automation parameter files
[%collapsible]

====

Ansible playbook executes database installation and configuration tasks with predefined parameters. For this Oracle automation solution, there are three user-defined parameter files that need user input before playbook execution.

* hosts - define targets that the automation playbook is running against.
* vars/vars.yml - the global variable file that defines variables that apply to all targets.
* host_vars/host_name.yml - the local variable file that defines variables that apply only to a named target. In our use case, these are the Oracle DB servers. 

In addition to these user-defined variable files, there are several default variable files that contain default parameters that do not require change unless necessary. The following sections show how to configure the user-defined variable files.  

====

=== Parameter files configuration
[%collapsible]

====

. Ansible target `hosts` file configuration:
+
include::../_include/automation_ora_anf_nfs_hosts.adoc[]

. Global `vars/vars.yml` file configuration
+
include::../_include/automation_ora_anf_nfs_vars.adoc[]

. Local DB server `host_vars/host_name.yml` configuration such as ora_01.yml, ora_02.yml ...
+
include::../_include/automation_ora_asa_iscsi_host_vars.adoc[]

====

=== Playbook execution
[%collapsible]

====

There are a total of five playbooks in the automation toolkit. Each performs different task blocks and serves different purposes.

      0-all_playbook.yml - execute playbooks from 1-4 in one playbook run.
      1-ansible_requirements.yml - set up Ansible controller with required libs and collections.
      2-linux_config.yml - execute Linux kernel configuration on Oracle DB servers.
      4-oracle_config.yml - install and configure Oracle on DB servers and create a container database. 
      5-destroy.yml - optional to undo the environment to dismantle all. 

There are three options to run the playbooks with the following commands. 

. Execute all deployment playbooks in one combined run.
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u azureuser -e @vars/vars.yml

. Execute playbooks one at a time with the number sequence from 1-4.
+
[source, cli]] 
ansible-playbook -i hosts 1-ansible_requirements.yml -u azureuser -e @vars/vars.yml
+
[source, cli] 
ansible-playbook -i hosts 2-linux_config.yml -u azureuser -e @vars/vars.yml
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 4-oracle_config.yml -u azureuser -e @vars/vars.yml

. Execute 0-all_playbook.yml with a tag.
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u azureuser -e @vars/vars.yml -t ansible_requirements
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u azureuser -e @vars/vars.yml -t linux_config
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u azureuser -e @vars/vars.yml -t oracle_config

. Undo the environment
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 5-destroy.yml -u azureuser -e @vars/vars.yml


====

=== Post execution validation
[%collapsible]

====

After the playbook run, login to the Oracle DB server VM to validate that Oracle is installed and configured and a container database is created successfully. Following is an example of Oracle database validation on host ora-01. 

. Validate NFS mounts
