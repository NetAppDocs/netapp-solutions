The following architecture diagram illustrates a highly available Oracle database deployment on Azure VM instances and the Azure NetApp Files storage.

Within the environment, the Oracle compute instance is deployed via Azure services virtual machines console. There are multiple Azure instance types available from the console. NetApp recommends deploying a database-oriented Azure VM instance that meets your expected workload.

Oracle database storage on the other hand is deployed with the Azure NetApp Files service available from Azure console. The Oracle binary, data, or log volumes are subsequently presented and mounted on an Azure VM instance Linux host.

In many respects, Azure NetApp Files implementation in Azure cloud is very similar to customer familiar on-premises ONTAP data storage architecture with many redundancy built-in such as RAID and dual controllers.  For disaster recovery, a standby site can be setup in different regions and database can be synced up with the primary site using application level replication such as Oracle Data Guard. 

This Azure Oracle environment can be managed with an Ansible controller node for automation using NetApp provided toolkits for database deployment, backup, recovery, and database migration etc. Any updates to the Oracle Azure VM instance operating system kernel or Oracle patching can be executed in parallel to keep the primary and standby in sync. In fact, the initial toolkits can be easily expanded to perform some repeating daily Oracle tasks if needed.
