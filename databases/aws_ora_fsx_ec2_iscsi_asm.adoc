== Purpose

ASM (Automatic Storage Management) is a popular Oracle storage volume manager that is employed in many Oracle installations. It is also Oracle's recommended storage management solution. It provides an alternative to conventional volume managers and file systems. Since Oracle version 11g, ASM has been packaged with grid infrastructure rather than a database. As a result, in order to utilize Oracle ASM for storage management without RAC, you must install Oracle grid infrastructure in a standalone server, also known as Oracle Restart. Doing so certainly adds more complexity in an otherwise simpler Oracle database deployment. However, as the name implies, when Oracle is deployed in Restart mode, any failed Oracle services are restarted after a host reboot without user intervention, which provides a certain degree of high availability or HA functionality.

In this documentation, we demonstrate how to deploy an Oracle database with the iSCSI protocol and Oracle ASM in an Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage environment with EC2 compute instances. We also demonstrate how to use the NetApp SnapCenter service through the NetApp BlueXP console to backup, restore, and clone your Oracle database for dev/test or other use cases for storage-efficient database operation in the AWS public cloud.  

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Oracle database deployment in Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage and EC2 compute instances with iSCSI/ASM 
* Testing and validating an Oracle workload in the public AWS cloud with iSCSI/ASM
* Testing and validating Oracle database Restart functionalities deployed in AWS

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who would like to deploy Oracle in an AWS public cloud with iSCSI/ASM.
* A database solution architect who would like to test Oracle workloads in the AWS public cloud.
* The storage administrator who would like to deploy and manage an Oracle database deployed to AWS FSx storage.
* The application owner who would like to stand up an Oracle database in AWS FSx/EC2.

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in an AWS FSx and EC2 environment that might not match the final deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key Factors for Deployment Consideration>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *EC2 compute instances.* In these tests and validations, we used an AWS EC2 t2.xlarge instance type for the Oracle database compute instance. NetApp recommends using an M5 type EC2 instance as the compute instance for Oracle in production deployment because it is optimized for database workloads. You need to size the EC2 instance appropriately for the number of vCPUs and the amount of RAM based on actual workload requirements.

* *FSx storage HA clusters single- or multi-zone deployment.* In these tests and validations, we deployed an FSx HA cluster in a single AWS availability zone. For production deployment, NetApp recommends deploying an FSx HA pair in two different availability zones. An FSx HA cluster is alway provisioned in a HA pair that is sync mirrored in a pair of active-passive file systems to provide storage-level redundancy. Multi-zone deployment further enhances high availability in the event of failure in a single AWS zone. 

* *FSx storage cluster sizing.* An Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage file system provides up to 160,000 raw SSD IOPS, up to 4GBps throughput, and a maximum of 192TiB capacity. However, you can size the cluster in terms of provisioned IOPS, throughput, and the storage limit (minimum 1,024 GiB) based on your actually requirements at the time of deployment. The capacity can be adjusted dynamically on the fly without affecting application availability.   

* *Oracle data and logs layout.* In our tests and validations, we deployed two ASM disk groups for data and logs respectively. Within the +DATA asm disk group, we provisioned four LUNs in a data volume. Within the +LOGS asm disk group, we provisioned two LUNs in a logs volume. In general, multiple LUNs laid out within an Amazon FSx for ONTAP volume provides better performance. 

* *iSCSI configuration.* The EC2 instance database server connects to FSx storage with the iSCSI protocol. EC2 instances generally deploy with a single network interface or ENI. The single NIC interface carries both iSCSI and application traffic. It is important to gauge the Oracle database peek I/O throughput requirement by carefully analyzing the Oracle AWR report in order to choose a right EC2 compute instance that meets both application and iSCSI traffic-throughput requirements. NetApp also recommends allocating four iSCSI connections to both FSx iSCSI endpoints with multipath properly configured.

* *Oracle ASM redundancy level to use for each Oracle ASM disk group that you create.* Because FSx already mirrors the storage on the FSx cluster level, you should use External Redundancy, which means that the option does not allow Oracle ASM to mirror the contents of the disk group.

* *Database backup.* NetApp provides a SaaS version of SnapCenter software service for database backup, restore, and clone in the cloud that is available through the NetApp BlueXP console UI. NetApp recommends implementing such a service to achieve fast (under a minute) SnapShot backup, quick (few minutes) database restore, and database cloning.    

== Solution deployment

The following section provides step-by-step deployment procedures. 

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====

Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. An AWS account has been set up, and the necessary VPC and network segments have been created within your AWS account.

. From the AWS EC2 console, you must deploy two EC2 Linux instances, one as the primary Oracle DB server and an optional alternative clone target DB server. See the architecture diagram in the previous section for more details about the environment setup. Also review the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[User Guide for Linux instances^] for more information.

. From the AWS EC2 console, deploy Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage HA clusters to host the Oracle database volumes. If you are not familiar with the deployment of FSx storage, see the documentation link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/creating-file-systems.html[Creating FSx for ONTAP file systems^] for step-by-step instructions.

. Steps 2 and 3 can be performed using the following Terraform automation toolkit, which creates an EC2 instance named `ora_01` and an FSx file system named `fsx_01`. Review the instruction carefully and change the variables to suit your environment before execution.
+
....
git clone https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_aws_fsx_ec2_deploy.git
....

[NOTE]

Ensure that you have allocated at least 50G in EC2 instance root volume in order to have sufficient space to stage Oracle installation files.

====

=== EC2 instance kernel configuration
[%collapsible]

====
With the prerequisites provisioned, log into the EC2 instance as ec2-user and sudo to root user to configure the Linux kernel for Oracle installation.

. Create a staging directory `/tmp/archive` folder and set the `777` permission.
+
....
mkdir /tmp/archive

chmod 777 /tmp/archive
....

. Download and stage the Oracle binary installation files and other required rpm files to the `/tmp/archive` directory.
+
See the following list of installation files to be stated in `/tmp/archive` on the EC2 instance.
+
....
