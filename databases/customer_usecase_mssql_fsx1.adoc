This real-world customer use case example illustrates the challenges, solutions, and outcomes of migrating SQL server workloads from on-premises to Amazon FSx ONTAP in order to reduce costs. 

== The Challenge

* The customer had been running SQL server workloads on private data center hosted by a third party and the increasing of hosting cost had become an issue.

* It's a large (100TB) and complex SQL Server environment with HA between two data centers via SQL Always On. Three transient environments created off secondary data copy using AppSync and data refreshed Daily/Weekly. Dedicated data flag changes after a refresh from production data. 

* It lacked tribal knowledge of application architecture and existing infrastructure due to outsourcing and employee attrition. 

* It's running against a tight timeline before a renewal decision on existing infrastructure.

* A DBA who manages databases in AWS EC2 environment.
* A database solution architect who is interested in database deployment in AWS EC2 ecosystem.
* A storage administrator who manages AWS FSx ONTAP storage that supports databases.
