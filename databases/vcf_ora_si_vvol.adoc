The solution provides an overview and details for Oracle deployment and protection in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) with vSphere Virtual Volumes (vVols) as primary database storage and Oracle database in a single instance (SI) configuration..

== Purpose

VMware vSphere Virtual Volumes (vVols) is a SAN/NAS management and integration framework that exposes virtual disks as native storage objects and enables array-based operations at the virtual disk level. In other words, vVols make SAN/NAS devices VM-aware and unlocks the ability to leverage array-based data services with a VM-centric approach at the granularity of a single virtual disk. vVols allows customers to leverage the unique capabilities of their current storage investments and 
transition without disruption to a simpler and more efficient operational model optimized for virtual environments that work across all storage types.

This documentation demonstrates the deployment and protection of an Oracle single instance database in a VMware Cloud Foundation environment with vVols as primary database storage in a NetApp ONTAP storage cluster. Oracle database is configured as if it is deployed in local file systems on a local storage system. This technical report focuses on steps in creating vVols in VCF for Oracle deployment. We also demonstrate how to use the NetApp SnapCenter UI tool to backup, restore, and clone an Oracle database for dev/test or other use cases for storage-efficient database operation in VCF. 


This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Oracle SI database deployment in VCF with vVols on NetApp ONTAP AFF as primary database storage 
* Oracle database backup and restore in VCF with vVols using NetApp SnapCenter UI tool 
* Oracle database clone for dev/test or other use cases in VCF with vVols using NetApp SnapCenter UI tool

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who would like to deploy Oracle in VCF with vVols on NetApp ONTAP AFF as primary database storage
* A database solution architect who would like to test Oracle workloads in VCF with vVols on NetApp ONTAP AFF storage
* A storage administrator who would like to deploy and manage an Oracle database deployed to VCF with vVols on NetApp ONTAP AFF storage
* An application owner who would like to stand up an Oracle database in VCF with vVol

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in a lab environment with VCF with vVols on NetApp ONTAP AFF storage that might not match the final deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key factors for deployment consideration>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *Protocol for vVols to ONTAP cluster connectivity.* NFS or iSCSI are good choices. The performance levels are equivalent. In this solution demonstration, we used NFS as a storage protocol for vVols connectivity to the underlined ONTAP storage cluster.

* *Oracle storage layout on vVols.* In our tests and validations, we deployed three vVols datastores for Oracle binary, Oracle data, and Oracle log files. It's good practice to separate different types of Oracle files into their datastore so that database backup, recovery, or clone can be easily managed and executed. Create dedicate vVols for large databases and share vVols for smaller databases or databases with similar QoS profile. 

* *Credential for ONTAP storage authentication.* Only use ONTAP cluster-level credentials for the ONTAP storage cluster authentication, including SnapCenter connectivity to the ONTAP storage cluster or ONTAP tool connectivity to the ONTAP storage cluster. 

* *Provision storage from vVols to database VM.* Add only one disk at a time to the database VM from the vVols datastore. Adding Multiple disks from vVols at the same time is not supported at this time.   

* *Database protection.* NetApp provides a SnapCenter software suite for database backup, restore, and cloning with a user-friendly UI interface. NetApp recommends implementing such a management tool to achieve fast (under a minute) SnapShot backup, quick (minutes) database restore, and database clone.    

== Solution deployment

The following sections provide step-by-step procedures for Oracle 19c deployment in VCF with vVols datastores on NetApp ONTAP storage in an Oracle single instance configuration.     

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====

Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. A VMware VCF has been setup. For information or instruction on how to create a VCF, please refer to VMware documentation link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/index.html[VMware Cloud Foundation Documentation^].

. Provision three Linux VMs, two VMs for Oracle database and one VM for Ansible controller within VCF workload domain. Provision one Windows server VM for running NetApp SnapCenter server. For information on setting up Ansible controller for automated Oracle database deployment, referring to following resources link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/automation/getting-started.html[Getting Started with NetApp solution automation^].

. SnapCenter plugin version 6.0 for VMware vSphere has been deployed in VCF. Refer to following resources for the plugin deployment: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere documentation^].

. ONTAP tool for VMware vSphere has been deployed in VCF. Refer to following resources for the ONTAP tool for VMware vSphere deployment: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere/index.html[ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation^]

[NOTE]

Ensure that you have allocated at least 50G in Oracle VM root volume in order to have sufficient space to stage Oracle installation files.

====

=== Create storage capability profile
[%collapsible]

====

First, create a custom storage capability profile for the underlined ONTAP storage that is hosting the vVols datastore.

. From vSphere client shortcuts, open NetApp ONTAP tool. Ensure that ONTAP storage cluster has been added to `Storage Systems` as part of ONTAP tool deployment. 
+

image:vcf_ora_vvol_scp_00.png["Screenshot showing a custom storage capability profile configuration."]

. Click on `Storage capability profile` to add a custom profile for Oracle. Name the profile and add a brief description.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_scp_02.png["Screenshot showing a custom storage capability profile configuration."]

. Choose storage controller category: performance, capacity, or hybrid.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_scp_03.png["Screenshot showing a custom storage capability profile configuration."]

. Select the protocol.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_scp_04.png["Screenshot showing a custom storage capability profile configuration."]

. Define a QoS policy if desired.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_scp_05.png["Screenshot showing a custom storage capability profile configuration."]

. Additional storage attributes for the profile. Be sure that the encryption is enabled on the NetApp controller if you want to have the encryption capability or it may cause issues when applying the profile.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_scp_06.png["Screenshot showing a custom storage capability profile configuration."]

. Review the summary and finish the storage capability profile creation.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_scp_07.png["Screenshot showing a custom storage capability profile configuration."]

====

=== Create and configure vVols
[%collapsible]

====

With the prerequisites completed, login to the VCF as an admin user via vSphere client, navigating to workload domain. Do not use built-in VMware storage option to create vVols. Instead, use NetApp ONTAP tool to create vVols. Following demonstrates the procedures to create and configure vVols. 

. The vVols creation workflow can be triggered either from ONTAP tool interface or from VCF workload domain cluster.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_datastore_01.png["Screenshot showing vVols datastore configuration."]
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_datastore_01_2.png["Screenshot showing vVols datastore configuration."]


. Filling in general information for datastore including provisioning destination, type, name, and protocol.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_datastore_02.png["Screenshot showing vVols datastore configuration."]

. Select the custom storage capability profile created from previous step, `Storage system`, and `Storage VM`, where vVols are to be created. 
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_datastore_03.png["Screenshot showing vVols datastore configuration."]

. Choose `Create new volumes`, fill in the volume name and size and click on `ADD` then `NEXT` to move to the summary page.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_datastore_04.png["Screenshot showing vVols datastore configuration."]

. Click `Finish` to create vVols datastore for Oracle binary. 
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_datastore_05.png["Screenshot showing vVols datastore configuration."]

. Repeat the same procedures to create vVols datastore for Oracle data and log. 
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_datastore_06.png["Screenshot showing vVols datastore configuration."]

[NOTE]

Notice that when an Oracle database is cloned, an additional vVols for Data is added to the vVols list.

====


=== Create VM storage policy based on storage capability profile
[%collapsible]

====

Before attaching vVols datastore to database VM, add a VM storage policy based on storage capability profile created from previous step. Following are the procedures.

. From vSphere client menus, open `Policies and Profiles` and highlight `VM Storage Policies`. Click `Create` to open `VM Storage Policies` workflow.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_policy_01.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage policy configuration."]

. Name the VM storage policy.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_policy_02.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage policy configuration."]

. In `Datastore specific rules`, check `Enable rules for "NetAPP.clustered.Data.ONTAP.VP.vvol" storage`
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_policy_03.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage policy configuration."]

. For NetApp.clustered.Data.ONTAP.VP.vvol rules `Placement`, select the custom storage capacity profile created from the previous step. 
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_policy_04.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage policy configuration."]

. For NetApp.clustered.Data.ONTAP.VP.vvol rules `Replication`, choose `Disabled` if vVols are not replicated.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_policy_04_1.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage policy configuration."]

. Storage compatibility page displays the compatible vVols datastores in VCF environment.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_policy_05.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage policy configuration."]

. Review and finish to create the VM Storage Policy.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_policy_06.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage policy configuration."]

. Validate the VM Storage Policy just created. 
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_policy_07.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage policy configuration."]

=== Allocate disks to DB VM from vVols datastore and configure DB storage
[%collapsible]

====

From vSphere client, add three disks from the vVols datastore to database VM by editing VM settings. Then, login to VM to format and mount the disks to mount points /u01, /u02, and /u03. The following demonstrates the exact steps and tasks.

. Add a disk to VM as Oracle binary storage.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_bins.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage configuration."]

. Add a disk to VM as Oracle data storage.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_data.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage configuration."]

. Add a disk to VM as Oracle log storage.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_logs.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage configuration."]

. From VM `Edit Settings`, `Advanced Parameters`, add Attribute `disk.enableuuid` with Value `TRUE`.  The VM needs to be down to add the advanced parameter.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_vm_uuid.png["Screenshot showing a VM storage configuration."]

. Now, restart the VM. Login to VM as an admin user via ssh to review the newly added disk drives.

=== Oracle database deployment in VCF
[%collapsible]

====

It's recommended to leverage NetApp automation toolkit to deploy Oracle in VCF with vVols. For detailed reference on executing Oracle automated deployment on xfs file systems, refer to TR-4992: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/databases/automation_ora_c-series_nfs.html[Simplified, Automated Oracle Deployment on NetApp C-Series with NFS^]. Although the TR-4992 covers automated Oracle deployment on the NetApp C-Series with NFS, it's identical to Oracle deployment in VCF with vVols if bypassing NFS file systems mounting to database VM. We would simply skip that with specific tags. Following are step by step procedures.

. Login to Ansible controller VM as admin user via ssh and clone a copy of automation toolkit for Oracle on NFS. 
+
[source, cli] 
git clone https://bitbucket.ngage.netapp.com/scm/ns-bb/na_oracle_deploy_nfs.git

. Stage the following Oracle installation files in /tmp/archive folder on database VM. The folder should allow all user access with 777 permission.
+
....
LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip
p34765931_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip
p6880880_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip
....

. Configure deployment target file - hosts, global variables file - vars/vars.yml, and local DB VM variables file - host_vars/host_name.yml according to instructions in this section of TR-4992: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/databases/automation_ora_c-series_nfs.html#parameter-files-configuration[Parameter files configuration^]. Comment out nfs_lif variable from local DB VM variable file.

. Set up ssh keyless authentication between Ansible controller and database VMs, which requires to generate a ssh key pair and copy the public key to database VMs admin user root directory .ssh folder authorized_keys file. 
+
[source, cli]
ssh-keygen

. From Ansible controller, cloned automation toolkit home directory /home/admin/na_oracle_deploy_nf, execute prerequisites playbook.
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 1-ansible_requirements.yml

. Execute Linux configuration playbook.
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 2-linux_config.yml -u admin -e @vars/vars.yml

. Execute Oracle deployment playbook.
+
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts 4-oracle_config.yml -u admin -e @vars/vars.yml --skip-tags "ora_mount_points,enable_dnfs_client"

. Optionally, all above playbooks can be executed from a single playbook run as well.
+
[source, cli] 
ansible-playbook -i hosts 0-all_playbook.yml -u admin -e @vars/vars.yml --skip-tags "ora_mount_points,enable_dnfs_client"

. Login to EM express to to validate Oracle after successful playbook execution.

=== Oracle backup, restore, and clone in VCF with SnapCenter
[%collapsible]

==== SnapCenter Setup
[%collapsible]

=====

SnapCenter version 6 has many feature enhancements over version 5, including support for VMware vVols. SnapCenter relies on a host-side plug-in on a database VM to perform application-aware data protection management activities. For detailed information on NetApp SnapCenter plug-in for Oracle, refer to this documentation link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-sco/concept_what_you_can_do_with_the_snapcenter_plug_in_for_oracle_database.html[What can you do with the Plug-in for Oracle Database^]. The following provides high-level steps to set up SnapCenter version 6 for Oracle database backup, recovery, and clone in VCF. 

. Download the version 6 of SnapCenter software from NetApp support site: link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/downloads[NetApp Support Downloads^].

. Login to the SnapCenter hosting Windows VM as administrator. Install prerequisites for SnapCenter 6.0.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_prerequisites.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter 6.0 prerequisites."]

. As administrator, install latest java JDK from link:https://www.java.com/en/[Get Java for desktop applications^].
+
[NOTE]

If Windows server is deployed in a domain environment, add a domain user to SnapCenter server local administrators group and run SnapCenter installation with the domain user. 

. Login to SnapCenter UI via HTTPS port 8846 as installation user to configure SnapCenter for Oracle.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_01.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Review `Get Started` menu to get up to speed on SnapCenter if you are a new user.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_02.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Update `Hypervisor Settings` in global settings.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_01.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Add ONTAP storage cluster to `Storage Systems` with cluster management IP and authenticated via cluster admin user ID. 
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_06.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_07.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Add database VM and vSphere plugin VM `Credential` for SnapCenter access to DB VM and vSphere plugin VM. The credential should have sudo privilege on the Linux VMs. 
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_03.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Add Oracle database VM in VCF to `Hosts` with DB VM credential created in previous step.  
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_08.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_09.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_10.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Similarly, add NetApp VMware plugin VM to `Hosts` with vSphere plugin VM credential created in previous step.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_11.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_deploy_12.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Finally, after Oracle database is discovered on DB VM, back to `Settings`-`Policies` to create Oracle database backup policies. Ideally, create a separate archive log backup policy to allow more frequent backup interval to minimize data loss in the event of a failure.
+
image:aws_ora_fsx_vmc_snapctr_02.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]


[NOTE]
Ensure that the SnapCenter server name can be resolved to the IP address from the DB VM and vSphere plugin VM. Equally, the DB VM name and vSphere plugin VM name can be resolved to the IP address from the SnapCenter server. 
 

=====

==== Database backup
[%collapsible]

=====

SnapCenter leverages ONTAP volume snapshot for much quicker database backup, restore, or clone compared with traditional RMAN based methodology. The snapshots are application-consistent as the database is put in Oracle backup mode before a snapshot. 

. From the `Resources` tab, any databases on the VM are auto-discovered after the VM is added to SnapCenter. Initially, the database status shows as `Not protected`.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_01.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Click on database to start a workflow to enable protection for the database.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_02.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Apply backup policy, setup scheduling if needed. 
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_03.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Setup backup job notification if required.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_05.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Review the summary and finish to enable database protection.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_06.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. On-demand backup job can be triggered by click on `Back up Now`.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_07.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_08.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. The backup job can be monitored at the `Monitor` tab by clicking on the running job.
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_09.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

. Click on database to review the backup sets completed for each database. 
+
image:vcf_ora_vvol_snapctr_bkup_10.png["Screenshot showing SnapCenter configuration."]

=====

==== Database restore/recovery
[%collapsible]

=====

SnapCenter provides a number of restore and recovery options for Oracle databases from snapshot backup. In this example, we demonstrate to restore from a older snapshot backup, then roll forward the database to the last available log. 

. First, run a snapshot backup. Then, create a test table and insert a row into table to validate that recovered database from snapshot image before test table creation regains the test table.
