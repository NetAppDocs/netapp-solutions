[.lead]
This solution has been designed to be run in an AWX/Tower environment.

== AWX/Tower

For AWX/Tower environments, you are guided through creating an inventory of your ONTAP cluster management and Oracle server (IPs and hostnames), creating credentials, configuring a project that pulls the Ansible code from NetApp Automation Github, and the Job Template that launches the automation.

. The solution has been designed to run in a private cloud scenario (on-premise to on-premise), and hybrid cloud (on-premise to public cloud Cloud Volumes ONTAP [CVO])
. Fill out the variables specific to your environment, and copy and paste them into the Extra Vars fields in your job template.
. After the extra vars have been added to your job template, you can launch the automation.
. The automation is set to be ran three phases (Setup, Replication Schedule for Oracle Binaries, Database, Logs, and Replication Schedule just for Logs), and a forth phase to recovering the database at a DR site.
. For detailed instructions for obtaining the keys and tokens necessary for the CVO Data Protection visit link:automation/authentication_tokens.html[Gather Pre-requisites For CVO and Connector Deployments]

This automated deployment is designed with a single Ansible playbook that consists of three separate roles. The roles are for ONTAP, Linux, and Oracle configurations.
The following table describes which tasks are being automated.

Pre-check of the ONTAP environment
| Creation of Intercluster LIFs on source cluster (OPTIONAL)
| Creation of Intercluster LIFs on destination cluster (OPTIONAL)
| Creation of Cluster and SVM Peering
| Creation of destination SnapMirror and Initialization of designated Oracle volumes
.4+|*ora_replication_cg* |

== Default parameters
To simplify automation, we have preset many required Oracle parameters with default values. It is generally not necessary to change the default parameters for most deployments. A more advanced user can make changes to the default parameters with caution. The default parameters are located in each role folder under defaults directory.
