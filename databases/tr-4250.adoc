TR-4250 addresses the challenges of designing storage solutions to support SAP business suite products using an Oracle database. The primary focus of this document is the common storage infrastructure design, deployment, operation, and management challenges faced by business and IT leaders who use the latest generation of SAP solutions. The recommendations in this document are generic; they are not specific to an SAP application or to the size and scope of the SAP implementation. TR-4250 assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of the technology and operation of NetApp and SAP products. TR-4250 was developed based on the interaction of technical staff from NetApp, SAP, Oracle, and our customers.
