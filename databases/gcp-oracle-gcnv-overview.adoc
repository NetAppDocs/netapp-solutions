== Architecture

You can run Oracle databases on Google Compute Engine with one or more storage volumes. The number of volumes depends on the level of data separation. For example, smaller databases might be placed on a single volume. Larger databases with more demanding IO or management requirements may require individual datafile, redo log, and archive log volumes. Additional volumes for application or backup data can be added as well. Each volume can be right-sized for the needs of the data to be hosted.
