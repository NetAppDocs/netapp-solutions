== Purpose
// Describe WHAT problem this solution addresses.  What are the use cases(s) and how does it solve a problem?
// Use a bulleted list and keep it brief!

PostgreSQL is one of widely used open source databases. It ranked at number four among the top ten most popular database engines by link:https://db-engines.com/en/ranking[DB-engines racking^]. On one hand, the PostgreSQL derives its popularity from its license free open source model while not lacking sophisticated features. On the other hand, because it is open sourced, there is shortage of detailed guidance on production grade database deployment in the area of high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR) particularly in public cloud. In general, it can be a complicated endeavor trying to setup typical PostgreSQL HA/DR with hot/warm standby, streaming replication etc. It can be difficulty, disruptive to production when testing the HA/DR environment by promoting standby site, then switching back to primary. There are well documented performance issues on the primary when you deploy read workload on streaming hot standby.  

In this documentation, we will demonstrate how you can do away with application level PostgreSQL streaming HA/DR solution and build a PostgreSQL HA/DR solution based on AWS FSx ONTAP storage for database files and EC2 compute instances as PostgreSQL DB servers. The solution creates a simpler and comparable system and delivers equivalent results as compared with traditional PostgreSQL application level streaming replication for HA/DR.  

The solution is built on mature, proven, popular NetApp SnapMirror storage level replication technology available in AWS native FSX ONTAP cloud storage for PostgreSQL HA/DR. It is simple to implement with automation toolkit provided by NetApp Solutions team. It provides similar functionalities while eliminating the complexity, performance drag on the primary site with the application level streaming based HA/DR solution. The solution can be easily deployed and tested without any impact to active primary site. 

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Production grade HA/DR deployment for PostgreSQL in AWS public cloud 
* Test and validate PostgreSQL workload in AWS public cloud
* Test and validate PostgreSQL HA/DR strategy based on NetApp SnapMirror replication technology

== Audience
// Who is this solution directed at?  DevOps engineer, IT specialist, DB administrator, etc.

.Key Factors for Deployment Consideration
[%collapsible]
=====
// Identify anything that might differ in a production environment that was different in a lab environment or assumptions that were made

* PostgreSQL database backup, restore, and recovery
  PostgreSQL database supports a number of backup methods, such as logical backup using pg_dump, physical online backup with pg_basebackup or lower level OS    backup command, and storage level consistent snapshot. This solution utilizes NetApp consistent group snapshots for PostgreSQL database data and wal volumes backup, restore, and recovery at standby site. The NetApp consistent group volumes snapshots ensure the IOs are sequenced as they are written to storage and ensure the integrity of database data files.      

* EC2 Compute Instances
  In the tests and validations, we used AWS EC2 t2.xlarge instance type as PostgreSQL database compute instance. It is recommended that in actual deployment, M5 type EC2 instance should be used as compute instance for PostgreSQL as it is optimized for database workload. The standby compute instance should always be deployed in the same zone as the passive (standby) file system as deployed for the FSx HA cluster. 

* FSx Storage HA Clusters Single or Multi Zones Deployment
  In the tests and validations, we deployed FSx HA cluster in a single AWS availability zone. For production deployment, it is recommended to deploy a FSx HA pair in two different availability zones and disaster recovery standby HA pair for business continuity can be setup in a different regions if certain physical distance between primary and standby is a requirement. FSx HA cluster is alway provisioned in a HA pair, which are sync mirrored in a pair of active/passive file systems to provide storage level redundancy. 

* PostgreSQL Data and Log Placement
  Typical PostgreSQL deployment share the same root directory or volumes for data and log files. In our tests and validations, we have separated PostgreSQL data and logs into two separate volumes for performance. A soft link is used in data directory to point to logs directory or volume, which hosts PostgreSQL WAL logs and archived WAL logs.

* PostgreSQL service startup delay timer 
  The solution utilizes the NFS mounted volumes to store PostgreSQL database file and WAL logs files. During database host reboot, PostgreSQL service may try to start while the volume is not mounted. This will result in database service startup failure. A 10-15 seconds timer delay is needed for the PostgreSQL database to start up correctly.

* RPO/RTO for Business Continuity
  FSx data replication from primary to standby for DR is based on ASYNC, which means RPO will depends on the frequency of SnapShot backup and SnapMirror replication. Higher frequency of SnapShot/SnapMirror reduce RPO thus the potential data loss in the event of disaster at the expense of incremental storage cost. It had been validated that SnapShot/SnapMirror replication can be implemented as low as 5 minutes interval for RPO and PostgreSQL can generally recovered at DR standby site within under a minute for RTO.

* Database backup 
  Once PostgreSQL database is implemented or migrated into AWS FSx storage from on-premisses data center, the data is auto sync mirrored in FSx HA pair for protection. The data protection is further hardened with a replicated standby site in case of a disaster. For longer term backup retention or data protection, it is recommended to use PostgreSQL built-in pg_basebackup utility to run full database backup that can be shipped to S3 blob storage.

Following tasks deploy PostgreSQL DB server service and initialize database at primary site on primary EC2 DB server host. Then, it sets up a standby primary EC2 DB server host at standby site. Finally, it sets up DB volumes replication from primary site FSx cluster to standby site FSx cluster for disaster recovery in the event of a failure.  

. Create db vols on primary fsx cluster and setup postgresql on primary EC2 instance host
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts postgresql_deploy.yml -u ec2-user --private-key psql_01p.pem -e @vars/fsx_vars.yml

. Setup the standby DR EC2 instance host
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts postgresql_standby_setup.yml -u ec2-user --private-key psql_01s.pem -e @vars/fsx_vars.yml

. Setup FSx ontap cluster peering and database volumes replication
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts fsx_replication_setup.yml -e @vars/fsx_vars.yml

. Consolidate above into single step PostgreSQL deployment and HA/DR setup
[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts postgresql_hadr_setup.yml -u ec2-user -e @vars/fsx_vars.yml

For setting up a standby PostgreSQL DB host at either primary or standby sites, comment out all other servers in hosts file [dr_postgresql] section and then execute postgresql_standby_setup.yml playbook with respective target host such as psql_01ps (standby EC2 compute instance at primary site). Make sure a host parameters file such as psql_01ps.yml is configured under host_vars directory. 

  [dr_postgresql] --   
  #psql_01s ansible_ssh_private_key_file=psql_01s.pem

.PostgreSQL Database Snapshot Backup and Replication to Standby Site
[%collapsible]
=====
PostgreSQL database snapshot backup and replication to standby site can be controlled and executed on Ansible controller with user defined interval. It was validated, the interval can be as low as 5 minutes as tested. It means, in the case of failure at the primary site, there is potential data loss up to 5 minutes when failure took place right before the next scheduled snapshot backup.

.Failover to Standby Site for DR
[%collapsible]
=====
For testing the PostgreSQL HA/DR system as a DR exercise, execute failover and PostgreSQL database recovery on primary standby EC2 DB instance on standby site by executing following playbook. In an actually DR scenario, execute the same for an actually failover to DR site.  

[source, cli]
ansible-playbook -i hosts postgresql_failover.yml -u ec2-user --private-key psql_01s.pem -e @vars/fsx_vars.yml
