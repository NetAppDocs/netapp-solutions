== Purpose

Oracle Data Guard ensures high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery for enterprise data in a primary database and standby database replication configuration. Oracle Active Data Guard empowers users to access standby databases while data replication is active from the primary database to standby databases. Data Guard is a feature of Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. It does not require separate licensing. On the other hand, Active Data Guard is an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Option therefore requires separate licensing. Multiple standby databases can receive data replication from a primary database in the Active Data Guard setup. However, each additional standby database requires an Active Data Guard license and extra storage as the size of primary database. The optional cost adds up quickly.

If you are keen on cutting back cost of your Oracle database operation and are planning to set up an Active Data Guard in AWS, you should consider an alternative. Instead of Active Data Guard, use Data Guard to replicate from primary database to a single copy of physical standby database on AWS FSx ONTAP storage. Subsequently, multiple copies of this standby database can be cloned and opened for read/write access to serve many other use cases such as reporting, development, test etc. The net results effectively deliver functionalities of Active Data Guard while eliminating Active Data Guard license and extra storage cost for each additional standby database. In this documentation, we demonstrate how to setup an Oracle Data Guard with your existing primary database in AWS and place physical standby database on AWS FSx ONTAP storage. The standby database is backed up via snapshot and cloned for read/write access for use cases as desired. 

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Oracle Data Guard between a primary database on any storage in AWS to standby database on AWS FSx ONTAP storage.
* Clone the standby database while closed for data replication to serve use cases such as reporting, dev, test, etc. 

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who set up Oracle Active Data Guard in AWS for high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery.
* A database solution architect interested in Oracle Active Data Guard configuration in the AWS cloud.
* A storage administrator who manages AWS FSx ONTAP storage that supports Oracle Data Guard.
* An application owner who like to stand up Oracle Data Guard in AWS FSx/EC2 environment.

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in an AWS FSx ONTAP and EC2 lab environment that might not match the final deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key Factors for Deployment Consideration>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *How Oracle Standby DB volume FlexClone Works.* AWS FSx ONTAP FlexClone provides shared copies of the same primary data volumes that are writable. The copies of the primary volume are actually pointers that link back to original data blocks until a new write initiates on the clone. ONTAP then allocated new storage blocks for the new writes. Any read IOs are serviced by original data blocks under active replication. Thus, the clone are very storage efficient that can be used for many other use cases with minimal and incremental new storage allocation for new write IOs. This provides tremendous storage cost saving by substantially reducing Active Data Guard storage footprint. NetApp recommends to minimize FlexClone activities in the event of database switching over from primary storage to standby FSx storage in order to maintain Oracle performance at high level. 

* *Oracle Software Requirements.* In general, a physical standby database must have the same Database Home version as the primary database including Patch Set Exceptions (PSEs), Critical Patch Updates (CPUs), and Patch Set Updates (PSUs), unless an Oracle Data Guard Standby-First Patch Apply process is in progress (as described in My Oracle Support note 1265700.1 at link:http://support.oracle.com.[support.oracle.com^]

* *Standby Database Directory Structure Considerations.* If possible, the data files, log files, and control files on the primary and standby systems should have the same names and path names and use Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA) naming conventions. The archival directories on the standby database should also be identical between sites, including size and structure. This strategy allows other operations such as backups, switchovers, and failovers to execute the same set of steps, reducing the maintenance complexity. 

* *Force Logging Mode.* To protect against unlogged direct writes in the primary database that cannot be propagated to the standby database, turn on FORCE LOGGING at the primary database before performing data file backups for standby creation. 

* *Database Storage Management.* For operational simplicity, Oracle recommends that when you set up Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) and Oracle Managed Files (OMF) in an Oracle Data Guard configuration that you set it up symmetrically on the primary and standby database(s).  

* *EC2 compute instances.* In these tests and validations, we used an AWS EC2 t2.xlarge instance as the Oracle database compute instance. NetApp recommends using an M5 type EC2 instance as the compute instance for Oracle in production deployment because it is optimized for database workload. You need to size the EC2 instance appropriately for the number of vCPUs and the amount of RAM based on actual workload requirements.

* *FSx storage HA clusters single- or multi-zone deployment.* In these tests and validations, we deployed an FSx HA cluster in a single AWS availability zone. For production deployment, NetApp recommends deploying an FSx HA pair in two different availability zones. An FSx HA cluster is alway provisioned in a HA pair that is sync mirrored in a pair of active-passive file systems to provide storage-level redundancy. Multi-zone deployment further enhances high availability in the event of failure in a single AWS zone. 

* *FSx storage cluster sizing.* An Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage file system provides up to 160,000 raw SSD IOPS, up to 4GBps throughput, and a maximum of 192TiB capacity. However, you can size the cluster in terms of provisioned IOPS, throughput, and the storage limit (minimum 1,024 GiB) based on your actually requirements at the time of deployment. The capacity can be adjusted dynamically on the fly without affecting application availability.   

== Solution deployment

It is assumed that you already have your primary Oracle database deployed in AWS EC2 environment within a VPC as the starting point for setting up Data Guard. The primary database is deployed using Oracle ASM for storage management.  Two ASM disk groups - +DATA and +LOGS are created for Oracle data files, log files, and control file etc. If you need help on Oracle deployment in AWS with ASM, please refer to following technical reports for help.

Your primary Oracle database can be running either on a FSx ONTAP or any other storage of choices within the AWS EC2 ecosystem. The following section provides step-by-step deployment procedures for setting up Oracle Data Guard between a primary EC2 DB server with ASM storage to a standby EC2 DB server with ASM storage.    

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====

Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. An AWS account has been set up, and the necessary VPC and network segments have been created within your AWS account.

. From the AWS EC2 console, you need to deploy minimum three EC2 Linux instances, one as the primary Oracle DB server, one as standby Oracle DB server, and an clone target DB server for reporting, dev, and test etc. See the architecture diagram in the previous section for more details about the environment setup. Also review the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[User Guide for Linux instances^] for more information.

. From the AWS EC2 console, deploy Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage HA clusters to host Oracle volumes that stores the Oracle standby database copy. If you are not familiar with the deployment of FSx storage, see the documentation link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/creating-file-systems.html[Creating FSx for ONTAP file systems^] for step-by-step instructions.

. Steps 2 and 3 can be performed using the following Terraform automation toolkit, which creates an EC2 instance named `ora_01` and an FSx file system named `fsx_01`. Review the instruction carefully and change the variables to suit your environment before execution. The template can be easily revised for your own deployment requirements.
+
....
git clone https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_aws_fsx_ec2_deploy.git
....

[NOTE]

Ensure that you have allocated at least 50G in EC2 instance root volume in order to have sufficient space to stage Oracle installation files.

=== Prepare the primary database for Data Guard
[%collapsible]

====

In this demonstration, we have setup a primary Oracle database called db1 on the primary EC2 DB server with two ASM disk groups in standalone Restart configuration with data files in ASM disk group +DATA and flash recovery area in ASM disk group +LOGS. Following illustrates the detailed procedures for setting up primary database for Data Guard. All steps should be executed as database owner oracle.

. Primary database db1 configuration on primary EC2 instance ip-172-30-15-45. The ASM disk groups can be on any type of storage within EC2 ecosystem.

=== Prepare standby database and activate Data Guard managed recovery
[%collapsible]

====

Oracle Data Guard requires OS kernel configuration and Oracle software stacks including patch sets on standby EC2 DB instance to match with primary EC2 DB instance. For easy management and simplicity, the standby EC2 DB instance database storage configuration ideally should match with the primary EC2 DB instance as well, such as the number and size of ASM disk groups. Following are detail procedures for setting up the standby EC2 DB instance for Data Guard. All commands should be executed as oracle owner user id.

. First, review the configuration of the primary database on primary EC2 instance. In this demonstration, we have setup a primary Oracle database called db1 on the primary EC2 DB instance with two ASM disk groups +DATA and +LOGS in standalone Restart configuration. The primary ASM disk groups may be on any type of storage within EC2 ecosystem. 


. Follow procedures in documentation link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/databases/aws_ora_fsx_ec2_iscsi_asm.html[TR-4965: Oracle Database Deployment and Protection in AWS FSx/EC2 with iSCSI/ASM^] to install and configure grid and Oracle on standby EC2 DB instance to match with primary database. The database storage should be provisioned and allocated to standby EC2 DB instance from FSx ONTAP with same storage capacity as primary EC2 DB instance.
+
[NOTE]

Stop at step 10 in `Oracle database installation` section. The standby database copy will be instantiated from primary database using dbca database duplication function. 

. Once Oracle software is installed and configured, from standby Oracle_Home dbs directory, copy oracle password from primary database.

[command, cli]
alter system set dg_broker_start=true scope=both;

. From primary database, connect to Data Guard Borker as SYSDBA.

=== Clone standby databse for other use cases 
[%collapsible]

====

The key benefit of staging standby database on AWS FSx ONTAP in Data Guard is that it can be FlexCloned to serve many other use cases with minimal additional storage investment. In the following section, we demonstrate how to snapshot and clone the mounted and under recovery standby database volumes on FSx ONTAP for other purposes, such as DEV, TEST, REPORT, etc., using the NetApp SnapCenter tool.

Following are high level procedures to clone a READ/WRITE capable database from the managed physical standby database in Data Guard using SnapCenter. For detail instructions on how to setup and configure SnapCenter, please refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/databases/hybrid_dbops_snapcenter_usecases.html[Hybrid Cloud Database Solutions with SnapCenter^] relavant Oracle sections.

. We begin with creating a test table and inserting a row into the test table on primary database. We will then validate if the transaction traverse down to standby and finally the clone.
