This solution is designed in a hybrid cloud setting to support on-premises production databases that can burst to all of the popular public clouds for dev/test and disaster recovery operations.

This solution supports all databases that are currently supported by SnapCenter, although only Oracle and SQL Server databases are demonstrated here. This solution is validated with virtualized database workloads, although bare-metal workloads are also supported.

We assume that production database servers are hosted on-premises with DB volumes presented to DB hosts from a ONTAP storage cluster. SnapCenter software is installed on-premises for database backup and data replication to the cloud. An Ansible controller is recommended but not required for database deployment automation or OS kernel and DB configuration syncing with a standby DR instance or dev/test instances in the public cloud.
