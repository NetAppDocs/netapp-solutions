This solution provides overview and details for quick recovery and clone of Oracle VLDB deployed to AWS EC2 compute instance with NFS mount on FSx ONTAP to staging a standby data file copy to be incrementally merged constantly via RMAN.

== Purpose

Recovering a Very Large Database (VLDB) in Oracle using the Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) backup tool can be a highly challenging task. The database restoration process from backup media in the event of a failure can be time-consuming, delaying the database recovery and potentially impacting your Service Level Agreement (SLA) significantly. However, starting from version 10g, Oracle introduced a RMAN feature that allows users to create staged image copies of the Oracle database data files on additional disk storage located on the DB server host. These image copies can be incrementally updated using RMAN on a daily basis. In the case of a failure, the Database Administrator (DBA) can swiftly switch the Oracle database from the failed media to the image copy, eliminating the need for a complete database media restore. The result is a greatly improved SLA, albeit at the cost of doubling the required database storage. 

If you are keen on SLA for your VLDB and contemplating moving the Oracle database to a public cloud such as AWS, you could set up a similar database protection structure using resources such as AWS FSx ONTAP for staging your standby database image copy. In this documentation, we demonstrate how to provision and export an NFS file system from AWS FSx ONTAP to be mounted on an Oracle database server for staging a standby database copy for quick recovery in the event of a primary storage failure. 

Better yet, we also show how you could leverage NetApp FlexClone to create a copy of the same staging NFS file system for other use cases such as standing up a dev/test Oracle environment with this same standby database image copy without additional storage investment. 

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* An Oracle VLDB image copy incremental merge via RMAN on NFS mount point off AWS FSx ONTAP storage.  
* Quick recovery of an Oracle VLDB by switching to database image copy on FSx ONTAP storage in the event of failure.
* Clone FSx ONTAP NFS file system volume storing an Oracle VLDB image copy to be used for standing up another database instance for other use cases. 

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who set up Oracle VLDB image copy incremental merge via RMAN in AWS for faster database recovery.
* A database solution architect who tests Oracle workloads in the AWS public cloud.
* A storage administrator who manages Oracle databases deployed to AWS FSx ONTAP storage.
* An application owner who would like to stand up Oracle databases in AWS FSx/EC2 environment.

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in an AWS FSx ONTAP and EC2 environment that might not match the final deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key factors for deployment consideration>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *Oracle VLDB storage layout for RMAN incremental merge.* In our tests and validations, the NFS volume for Oracle incremental backup and merge is allocated from a single FSx file system, which has 4GBps throughput, 160,000 raw SSD IOPS, and 192TiB capacity limit. For deployment over the thresholds, multiple FSx file systems can be concatenated in parallel with multiple NFS mount points to provide higher capacity. 

* *Oracle recoverability using RMAN incremental merge.* The RMAN incremental backup and merge is generally executed at user defined frequency based on your RTO and RPO objectives. If there are total loss of primary data storage and/or archived logs, the data loss can occur. The Oracle database can be recovered up to last incremental backup that is available from FSx database backup image copy. To minimize the data loss, Oracle flash recovery area can be setup on FSx NFS mount point and archived logs are backed up to FSx NFS mount along with database image copy. 

* *Running Oracle VLDB off FSx NFS file system.* Unlike other bulk storage for database backup, AWS FSx ONTAP is a cloud enabled production grade storage that delivers high level of performance and storage efficiency. Once Oracle VLDB switches over from primary storage to image copy on FSx ONTAP NFS file system, database performance can be maintained at high level while the primary storage failure is addressed. You can take comfort to know that user application experience does not suffer as the result of primary storage failure. 

* *FlexClone Oracle VLDB image copy of NFS volume for other use cases.* AWS FSx ONTAP FlexClone provides shared copies of the same NFS data volume that are writable. Thus, they can be used for many other use cases while still maintaining the integrity of staging Oracle VLDB image copy even when Oracle database is switched over. This provides tremendous storage cost saving by substantially reducing VLDB storage footprint. NetApp recommends to minimize FlexClone activities in the event of database switching over from primary storage to database image copy in order to maintain Oracle performance at high level. 

* *EC2 compute instances.* In these tests and validations, we used an AWS EC2 t2.xlarge instance as the Oracle database compute instance. NetApp recommends using an M5 type EC2 instance as the compute instance for Oracle in production deployment because it is optimized for database workload. You need to size the EC2 instance appropriately for the number of vCPUs and the amount of RAM based on actual workload requirements.

* *FSx storage HA clusters single- or multi-zone deployment.* In these tests and validations, we deployed an FSx HA cluster in a single AWS availability zone. For production deployment, NetApp recommends deploying an FSx HA pair in two different availability zones. An FSx HA cluster is alway provisioned in a HA pair that is sync mirrored in a pair of active-passive file systems to provide storage-level redundancy. Multi-zone deployment further enhances high availability in the event of failure in a single AWS zone. 

* *FSx storage cluster sizing.* An Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage file system provides up to 160,000 raw SSD IOPS, up to 4GBps throughput, and a maximum of 192TiB capacity. However, you can size the cluster in terms of provisioned IOPS, throughput, and the storage limit (minimum 1,024 GiB) based on your actually requirements at the time of deployment. The capacity can be adjusted dynamically on the fly without affecting application availability.   

* *dNFS configuration.* dNFS is built into Oracle kernel and is known to dramatically increase Oracle database performance when Oracle is deployed to NFS storage. dNFS is packaged into Oracle binary but is not turned on by default. It should be turned on for any Oracle database deployment on NFS. For multiple FSx file systems deployment for a VLDB, dNFS multi-path to different FSx NFS file systems should be properly configured.   


== Solution deployment

It is assumed that you already have your Oracle VLDB deployed in AWS EC2 environment within a VPC. If you need help on Oracle deployment in AWS, please refer to following technical reports for help. 

* link:aws_ora_fsx_ec2_deploy_intro.html[Oracle Database Deployment on EC2 and FSx Best Practices^]

Your Oracle VLDB can be running either on a FSx ONTAP or any other storage of choices within the AWS EC2 ecosystem. The following section provides step-by-step deployment procedures for setting up RMAN incremental merge to an image copy of an Oracle VLDB that is staging in an NFS mount off AWS FSx ONTAP storage.    

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====

Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. An AWS account has been set up, and the necessary VPC and network segments have been created within your AWS account.

. From the AWS EC2 console, you must deploy two EC2 Linux instances, one as the primary Oracle DB server and an optional alternative clone target DB server. See the architecture diagram in the previous section for more details about the environment setup. Also review the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[User Guide for Linux instances^] for more information.

. From the AWS EC2 console, deploy Amazon FSx for ONTAP storage HA clusters to host the NFS volumes that stores the Oracle database standby image copy. If you are not familiar with the deployment of FSx storage, see the documentation link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/creating-file-systems.html[Creating FSx for ONTAP file systems^] for step-by-step instructions.

. Steps 2 and 3 can be performed using the following Terraform automation toolkit, which creates an EC2 instance named `ora_01` and an FSx file system named `fsx_01`. Review the instruction carefully and change the variables to suit your environment before execution. The template can be easily revised for your own deployment requirements.
+
....
git clone https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_aws_fsx_ec2_deploy.git
....

[NOTE]

Ensure that you have allocated at least 50G in EC2 instance root volume in order to have sufficient space to stage Oracle installation files.

====

=== Provision and export NFS volume to be mounted to EC2 DB instance host
[%collapsible]

====

In this demonstration, we will show how to provision an NFS volume from the command line by login to an FSx cluster via ssh as fsxadmin user through FSx cluster management IP. Alternatively, the volume can be allocated using the AWS FSx console as well. Repeat the procedures on other FSx file systems if more than one FSx file system are set up to accommodate the size of the database. 

. First, provision NFS volume via CLI by logging to the FSx cluster through SSH as the fsxadmin user. Change to your FSx cluster management IP address, which can be retrieved from AWS FSx ONTAP UI console. 
+
[source, cli]
ssh fsxadmin@172.30.15.53

. Create NFS volume the same size as your primary storage for storing primary Oracle VLDB database data files image copy.
+ 
[source, cli]
vol create -volume ora_01_copy -aggregate aggr1 -size 100G -state online -type RW -junction-path /ora_01_copy -snapshot-policy none -tiering-policy snapshot-only


. Alternatively, the volume can be provisioned from AWS FSx console UI with options: storage efficiency `Enabled`, security style `Unix` , Snapshot policy `None`, and Storage tiering `Snapshot Only` as show below.
+
image::aws_ora_fsx_ec2_vldb_vol.png[]

. Create a customized snapshot policy for oracle database with a daily schedule and 30 days retention. You should adjust the policy to fit your specific needs in terms of snapshot frequency and retention window. 
+
[source, cli] 
snapshot policy create -policy oracle -enabled true -schedule1 daily -count1 30
+
Apply policy to provisioned NFS volume for RMAN incremental backup and merge.
+
[source, cli]
vol modify -volume ora_01_copy -snapshot-policy oracle

. Login to EC2 instance as ec2-user and create a directory /nfsfsxn. Create additional mount point directories for additional FSx file systems.
+ 
[source, cli]
sudo mkdir /nfsfsxn

. Mount the FSx ONTAP NFS volume to EC2 DB instance host. Change to your FSx virtual server NFS lif address. The NFS lif address can be retrieved from FSx ONTAP UI console.
+
[source, cli]
sudo mount 172.30.15.19:/ora_01_copy /nfsfsxn -o rw,bg,hard,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,nointr

. Change mount point ownership to oracle:oisntall, change to your oracle user name and primary group as necessary.
+
[source, cli]
sudo chown oracle:oinstall /nfsfsxn

====

=== Setup Oracle RMAN incremental merge to image copy on FSx
[%collapsible]

====

RMAN incremental merge update the staging database data files image copy continuously at every incremental backup/merge interval. The image copy of database backup will be as up to date as the frequency you execute the incremental backup/merge. So, take into consideration of database performance, your RTO and RPO objectives when deciding the frequency of RMAN incremental backup and merge.

. Login to primary DB server EC2 instance as oracle user

. Create an oracopy directory under mount point /nfsfsxn to store oracle data files image copies and archlog directory for Oracle flash recovery area.
+
[source, cli]
mkdir /nfsfsxn/oracopy
+
[source, cli]
mkdir /nfsfsxn/archlog

. Login to Oracle database via sqlplus, enable block change tracking for faster incremental backup and change Oracle flash recovery area to FSxN mount if it is currently on primary storage. This allows the RMAN default control file/spfile autobackup and archived logs to be backed up to FSxN NFS mount for recovery.
+
[source, cli]
sqlplus / as sysdba
+
From sqlplus prompt, execute following command.
[source, cli]
alter database enable block change tracking using file '/nfsfsxn/oracopy/bct_db1.ctf'
+
[source, cli]
alter system set db_recovery_file_dest='/nfsfsxn/archlog/' scope=both;

. Create a RMAN backup and incremental merge script. The script allocates multiple channels for parallel RMAN backup and merge. First execution would generate the initial full baseline image copy. In a complete run, it first purges obsolete backups that are outside of retention window to keep staging area clean. It then switches current log file before merge and backup. The incremental backup follows the merge so that the database image copy is trailing current database state by one backup/merge cycle. The merge and backup order can be reversed for quicker recovery at user's preference. The RMAN script can be integrated into a simple shell script to be executed from crontab on the primary DB server. Ensure control file autobackup is on in RMAN setting. 
+
....
vi /home/oracle/rman_bkup_merge.cmd

Add following lines:

RUN
{
  allocate channel c1 device type disk format '/nfsfsxn/oracopy/%U';
  allocate channel c2 device type disk format '/nfsfsxn/oracopy/%U';
  allocate channel c3 device type disk format '/nfsfsxn/oracopy/%U';
  allocate channel c4 device type disk format '/nfsfsxn/oracopy/%U';
  delete obsolete;
  sql 'alter system archive log current';
  recover copy of database with tag 'OraCopyBKUPonFSxN_level_0';
  backup incremental level 1 copies=1 for recover of copy with tag 'OraCopyBKUPonFSxN_level_0' database;
}

....

. At EC2 DB server, login to RMAN locally as oracle user with or without RMAN catalog. In this demonstration, we are not connecting to a RMAN catalog. 
+
....

rman target / nocatalog;

output:

[oracle@ip-172-30-15-99 ~]$ rman target / nocatalog;

This completes the setup of Oracle database standby image copy backup and merge.

====

=== Switch Oracle DB to image copy for quick recovery
[%collapsible]
 
====
In the event of a failure due to primary storage issue such as data loss or corruption,  database can be quickly switched over to image copy on FSx ONTAP NFS mount and recovered to current state without database restore. Eliminating media restoration speeds up the database recovery tremendously for a VLDB. This use case assumes that the database host instance is intact and database control file, archived and current logs are all available for recovery.

. Login to EC2 DB server host as oracle user and create a test table before switch over.

. You could run the Oracle database in FSx NFS mount for an extended period without a performance penalty because FSx ONTAP is redundant production-grade storage that delivers high performance. When the primary storage issue is fixed, you can swing back to it by reversing the incremental backup merge processes with minimal downtime.  


====

=== Oracle DB recovery from image copy to different EC2 DB instance host
[%collapsible]

====
In a failure when both primary storage and EC2 DB instance host are lost, the recovery can not be conducted from the original server. Fortunately, you still have an Oracle database backup image copy on the redundant FSxN NFS file system. You could quickly provision another identical EC2 DB instance and easily mount the image copy of your VLDB to the new EC2 DB host via NFS to run recovery. In this section, we will demonstrate the step-by-step procedures for doing so.


. Insert a row to test table we have created previously for Oracle database restoring to alternative host validation.

. Shutdown primary EC2 DB instance host to simulate a total failure of storage and DB server host.

. Privison a new EC2 DB instance host ora_02 with same OS and version via AWS EC2 console. Configure OS kernal with same patches as primary EC2 DB server host, Oracle preinstall RPM, and add swap space to the host as well. Install same version and patches of Oracle as in primary EC2 DB server host with software only option. These tasks can be automated with NetApp automation toolkit as available from below links.

Toolkit: link:https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_oracle19c_deploy[na_oracle19c_deploy^]
Documentation: link:marketing_overview.html#awxtower-deployments[Automated Deployment of Oracle19c for ONTAP on NFS^]

. Configure oracle environment similiarly to primary EC2 DB instance host ora_01, such as oratab, oraInst.loc, and oracle user .bash_profile. It is a good practice to backup those files to FSxN NFS mount point.

. The Oracle database backup image copy on FSxN NFS mount is stored on a FSx cluster that spans AWS availability zones for redundancy, high avilability, and high performance. The NFS file system can be easily mounted to a new server as far as the networking is reachable. The following procedures mount the image copy of an Oracle VLDB backup to newly provsioned EC2 DB instance host for recovery.
+
As ec2-user, create the mount point.
+
[source, cli]
sudo mkdir /nfsfsxn
+
As ec2-user, mount the NFS volume that stored Oracle VLDB backup image copy.
[source, cli]
sudo mount 172.30.15.19:/ora_01_copy /nfsfsxn -o rw,bg,hard,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,nointr

. Validate the Oracle database backup image copy on FSxN NFS mount point.

. As oracle user, set ORACLE_HOME variable to current Oracle installation on new EC2 instance DB host ora_02, ORACLE_SID to primary Oracle instance SID. In this case, it is db1.

. As oracle user, create a generic Oracle init file in $ORACLE_HOME/dbs directory with proper admin directories configured. Most importantly, have Oracle `flash recovery area` point to FSxN NFS mount path as defined in primary Oracle VLDB instance.  `flash recovery area` configuration is demonstrated in section `Setup Oracle RMAN incremental merge to image copy on FSx`. Set the Oracle control file to FSx ONTAP NFS file system.

[NOTE]

For faster recovery, enable parallel sessions with recovery_parallelism parameter or specify degree of parallel in recovery command for database recovery: `RECOVER DATABASE PARALLEL (DEGREE d INSTANCES DEFAULT);`. In general, degrees of parallelism should be equal to number of CPU cores on the host.

. Exit RMAN, login to Oracle as oracle user via sqlplus to open database and reset log after an incomplete recovery.

....

Add FSxN NFS mount to fstab so that the NFS file system will be mounted when EC2 instance host rebooted.

As EC2 user, vi /etc/fstab and add following entry:

172.30.15.19:/ora_01_copy       /nfsfsxn        nfs     rw,bg,hard,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,nointr  0       0

Update the Oracle init file from primary databse init file backup that is restored to /tmp/archive and create spfile as needed.

....

This completes the Oracle VLDB database recovery from backup image copy on FSxN NFS file system to a new EC2 DB instance host.

====

=== Clone Oracle standby image copy for other use cases 
[%collapsible]

====

Another benefit of using AWS FSx ONTAP for staging Oracle VLDB image copy is that it can be FlexCloned to serve many other purposes with minimal additional storage investment. In the following use case,  we demonstrate how to snapshot and clone the staging NFS volume on FSx ONTAP for other Oracle use cases such as DEV, UAT, etc.  

. We begin with inserting a row into the same test table we have created before.

. The recovery processes now are similar to previous use case of recovery to a new EC2 DB instance after a failure - set oracle environment (oratab, $ORACLE_HOME, $ORACLE_SID) to match with primary production instance, create an init file including db_recovery_file_dest_size and db_recovery_file_dest that point to flash recovery directory on FSx NFS mount. Then, lanuch RMAN to run recovery. Following are command steps and output.

This completes the clone of a new Oracle instance from staging database copy on FSx NFS mount for DEV, UAT, or any other use cases. Multiple Oracle instances can be cloned off the same staging image copy.

[NOTE]

If you run into error `RMAN-06571: datafile 1 does not have recoverable copy` when switching the database to copy, check database incarnation that matches with primary production DB. If needed, reset the incarnation to match with primary with RMAN command `reset database to incarnation n;`.
