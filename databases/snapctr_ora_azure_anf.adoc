== Purpose

NetApp SnapCenter software is an easy-to-use enterprise platform to securely coordinate and manage data protection across applications, databases, and file systems. It simplifies backup, restore, and clone lifecycle management by offloading these tasks to application owners without sacrificing the ability to oversee and regulate activity on the storage systems. By leveraging storage-based data management, it enables increased performance and availability, as well as reduced testing and development times.

In TR-4987, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/databases/automation_ora_anf_nfs.html[Simplified, Automated Oracle Deployment on Azure NetApp Files with NFS^], we demonstrated automated Oracle deployment in Azure cloud, in this documentation we showcase Oracle database protection and management on Azure NetApp Files (ANF) in Azure cloud with a very user-friendly SnapCenter UI interface. 

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Backup and recovery of Oracle database deployed on ANF in Azure cloud with SnapCenter  
* Manage database snapshot and clone copies to accelerate application development and improve data lifecycle management

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who would like to deploy Oracle on Azure NetApp Files.
* A database solution architect who would like to test Oracle workloads on Azure NetApp Files.
* A storage administrator who would like to deploy and manage an Oracle database on Azure NetApp Files.
* An application owner who would like to stand up an Oracle database on Azure NetApp Files.

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution were performed in a lab setting that might not match the final deployment environment. See the section <<Key Factors for Deployment Consideration>> for more information.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *SnapCenter deployment.* SnapCenter can deploy in a Windows domain or Workgroup environment. For domain-based deployment, the domain user account should be a domain administrator account, or the domain user belongs to the local administrator's group on the SnapCenter hosting server.    

* *Name resolution.* SnapCenter server needs to resolve the name to the IP address for each managed target database server host. Each target database server host must resolve the SnapCenter server name to the IP address. If a DNS server is unavailable, add naming to local host files for resolution.  

* *Resource group configuration.* Resource group in SnapCenter is a logical grouping of similar resources that can be backed up together. Thus, it simplifies and reduces the number of backup jobs in a large database environment. 

* *Separate full database and archive log backup.* Full database backup includes data volumes and log volumes consistent group snapshots. A frequent full database snapshot incurs higher storage consumption but improves RTO. An alternative is less frequent full database snapshots and more frequent archive logs backup, which consumes less storage and improves RPO but may extend RTO. Consider your RTO and RPO objectives when setting up the backup scheme. There is also a limit (1023) on the number of snapshot backups on a volume.

* *Privilege delegation.* Leverage role based control that is built-in within SnapCenter UI to delegate privileges to application and database teams if desired. 
  
== Solution deployment

The following sections provide step-by-step procedures for SnapCenter deployment, configuration, and Oracle database backup, recovery, and clone on Azure NetApp Files in the Azure cloud.  

=== Prerequisites for deployment

=== Database backup
[%collapsible]

====

A NetApp snapshot backup creates a point-in-time image of the database volumes that you can use to restore in case of a system failure or data loss. Snapshot backups take very little time, usually less than a minute. The backup image consumes minimal storage space and incurs negligible performance overhead because it records only changes to files since the last snapshot copy was made. Following section demonstrates the implementation of snapshots for Oracle database backup in SnapCenter. 

. Navigating to `Resources` tab, which lists the databases discovered once SnapCenter plugin installed on database VM. Initially, the `Overall Status` of database shows as `Not protected`.  
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_01.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. Click on `View` drop-down  to change to `Resource Group`. Click on `Add` sign on the right to add a Resource Group.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_02.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. Name your resource group, tags, and any custom naming.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_03.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. Add resources to your `Resource Group`. Grouping of similar resources can simplify database management in a large environment.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_04.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. Select the backup policy and set a schedule by click on '+' sign under `Configure Schedules`.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_05.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_06.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. If backup verification is not configured in policy, leave verification schedule as is. 
+ 
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_07.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]
  
. In order to email a backup report and notification, a SMTP mail server is needed in the environment. Or leave it black if a mail server is not setup.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_08.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. Summary of new resource group.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_09.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. Repeat the above procedures to create a database archive log only backup with corresponding backup policy.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_10_1.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. Click on a resource group to reveal the resources it includes. Besides the scheduled backup job, an one-off backup can be triggered by click on `Backup Now`.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_10.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_11.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. Click on the running job to open a monitoring window, which allows the operator to track the job progress in real-time.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_12.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

. A snapshot backup set appears under database topology once a successful backup job finishes. A full database backup set includes a snapshot of the database data volumes and a snapshot of the database log volumes. A log-only backup contains only a snapshot of the database log volumes. 
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_bkup_13.png["This image provides database backup for SnapCenter server"]

====

=== Database recovery
[%collapsible]

====

Database recovery via SnapCenter restores a snapshot copy of the database volume image point-in-time. The database is then rolled forward to a chosen point as allowed by available archive logs. The following section demonstrates the workflow of database recovery with SnapCenter UI. 

. From `Resource` tab, open the database `Primary Backup(s)` page. Choose the snapshot of database data volume, then click on `Restore` button to launch database recovery workflow. Note the SCN number in the backup sets if you like to run the recovery by Oracle SCN.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_restore_01.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

. Select `Restore Scope`. For a container database, SnapCenter is flexible to perform a full container database (All Datafiles), pluggable databases, or tablespaces level restore. 
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_restore_02.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

. Select `Recovery Scope`. All logs mean to apply all available archive logs in the backup set. Point-in-time recovery by SCN or timestamp are also available.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_restore_03.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"] 

. The `PreOps` allows execution of scripts against database before restore/recovery operation.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_restore_04.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

. The `PostOps` allows execution of scripts against database after restore/recovery operation.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_restore_05.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

. Notification via email if desired.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_restore_06.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

. Restore job summary
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_restore_07.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

. Click on running job to open `Job Details` window. The job status can also be opened and viewed from the `Monitor` tab.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_restore_08.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

====

=== Database clone
[%collapsible]

====

Database clone via SnapCenter is accomplished by creating a new volume from a snapshot of a volume. The system uses the snapshot information to clone a new volume using the data on the volume when the snapshot was taken. More importantly, it is quick (a few minutes) and efficient compared with other methods to make a cloned copy of the production database to support development or testing. Thus, dramatically improve your database application lifecycle management. The following section demonstrates the workflow of database clone with SnapCenter UI.

. From `Resource` tab, open the database `Primary Backup(s)` page. Choose the snapshot of database data volume, then click on `clone` button to launch database clone workflow.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_01.png["This image provides database clone for SnapCenter server"]

. Name the clone database SID. Optionally, for a container database, clone can be done at PDB level as well.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_02.png["This image provides database clone for SnapCenter server"]

. Select the DB server where you want to place your cloned database copy. Keep the default file locations unless you want to name them differently.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_03.png["This image provides database clone for SnapCenter server"]

. Identical Oracle software stack as in source database should have been installed and configured on clone DB host. Keep the default credential but change `Oracle Home Settings` to match with settings on clone DB host.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_04.png["This image provides database clone for SnapCenter server"]

. The `PreOps` allows execution of scripts before clone operation. Database parameters can be adjusted to meet a clone DB needs as versus a production database, such as reduced SGA target.  
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_05.png["This image provides database clone for SnapCenter server"]

. The `PostOps` allows execution of scripts against database after clone operation. Clone database recovery can be SCN, timestamp based, or Until cancel (rolling forward database to last archived log in backup set).
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_06.png["This image provides database clone for SnapCenter server"]

. Notification via email if desired.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_07.png["This image provides database clone for SnapCenter server"]

. Clone job summary.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_08.png["This image provides database clone for SnapCenter server"]

. Click on running job to open `Job Details` window. The job status can also be opened and viewed from the `Monitor` tab.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_09.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

. Cloned database registers with SnapCenter immediately.
+
image::snapctr_ora_azure_anf_clone_10.png["This image provides database restore for SnapCenter server"]

. Validate clone database on DB server host. For a cloned development database, database archive mode should be turned off.
