== Purpose

This toolkit automates the tasks of provisioning of an AWS FSx ONTAP storage cluster and an EC2 compute instance, which can be subsequently used for database deployment. 


This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Provision an EC2 compute instance in AWS cloud in a predefined VPC subnet and set ssh key for EC2 instance access as ec2-user.
* Provision an AWS FSx ONTAP storage cluster in desired availability zones and configure a storage SVM and set cluster admin user fsxadmin password. 

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people:

* A DBA who manages databases in AWS EC2 environment.
* A database solution architect who is interested in database deployment in AWS EC2 ecosystem.
* A storage administrator who manages AWS FSx ONTAP storage that supports databases.
* An application owner who likes to standup database in AWS EC2 ecosystem.

== Solution deployment

=== Prerequisites for deployment
[%collapsible]
====
Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

  An Organization and AWS account has been setup in AWS public cloud
    An user to run the deployment has been created
    IAM roles has been configured 
    IAM roles granted to user to permit provisioning the resources


  VPC and security configuration
    A VPC has been created to host the resources to be provisioned
    A security group has been configured for the VPC
    A ssh key pair has been created for EC2 instance access 

  Network configuration
    Subnets has been created for VPC with network segments assigned 
    Route tables and network ACL configured 
    NAT gateways or internet gateways configured for internet access 

====

=== Download the toolkit
[%collapsible]
====

[source, cli]
git clone https://github.com/NetApp/na_aws_fsx_ec2_deploy.git

====

=== Connectivity and authentication
[%collapsible]
====

The toolkit is supposed to be executed from an AWS cloud shell. AWS cloud shell is a browser-based shell that makes it easy to securely manage, explore, and interact with your AWS resources. CloudShell is pre-authenticated with your console credentials. Common development and operations tools are pre-installed, so no local installation or configuration is required.

====

=== Terraform provider.tf and main.tf files configuration
[%collapsible]
====

The provider.tf defines the provider that Terraform is provisioning resources from via API calls. The main.tf defines the resources and attributes of resources that are to be provisioned. Following are some details:

  provider.tf:
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        aws = {
          source  = "hashicorp/aws"
          version = "~> 4.54.0"
        }
      }
    }

  main.tf:
    resource "aws_instance" "ora_01" {
      ami                           = var.ami 
      instance_type                 = var.instance_type
      subnet_id                     = var.subnet_id
      key_name                      = var.ssh_key_name
      root_block_device {
        volume_type                 = "gp3"
        volume_size                 = var.root_volume_size
      }
      tags = {
        Name                        = var.ec2_tag
      }
    }
    ....
====

=== Terraform variables.tf and terraform.tfvars configuration
[%collapsible]
====

The variables.tf declares the variables to be used in main.tf. The terraform.tfvars contains the actual values for the variables. Following are some examples:

  variables.tf:
    ### EC2 instance variables ###

    variable "ami" {
      type        = string 
      description = "EC2 AMI image to be deployed"
    }

    variable "instance_type" {
      type        = string
      description = "EC2 instance type"
    }
    ....

  terraform.tfvars:
    # EC2 instance variables

    ami                     = "ami-06640050dc3f556bb" //RedHat 8.6  AMI
    instance_type           = "t2.micro"
    ec2_tag                 = "ora_01"
    subnet_id               = "subnet-04f5fe7073ff514fb"
    ssh_key_name            = "sufi_new"
    root_volume_size        = 30
    ....
