== Deploy an EC2 Linux instance for Oracle via EC2 console

If you are new to AWS, you first need to set up an AWS environment. The documentation tab at the AWS website landing page provides EC2 instruction links on how to deploy a Linux EC2 instance that can be used to host your Oracle database via the AWS EC2 console. The following section is a summary of these steps. For details, see the linked AWS EC2-specific documentation.

=== Setting up your AWS EC2 environment

You must create an AWS account to provision the necessary resources to run your Oracle environment on the EC2 and FSx service. The following AWS documentation provides the necessary details:

* link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html[Set up to use Amazon EC2^]

Key topics:

* Sign up for AWS.
* Create a key pair.
* Create a security group.

=== Enabling multiple availability zones in AWS account attributes

For an Oracle high availability configuration as demonstrated in the architecture diagram, you must enable at least four availability zones in a region. The multiple availability zones can also be situated in different regions to meet the required distances for disaster recovery.
