== AWS Public Cloud

[NOTE]
To make things easier to follow, we have created this document based on a deployment in AWS, however the process is very similar in Azure and GCP too.

=== 1. Pre-flight check

Before deploying anything, ensure that the infrastructure is in place to allow for the deployment in the next stage. This includes:

[%interactive]
* [ ] AWS account
* [ ] VPC in your region of choice
* [ ] Subnet with access to the public internet
* [ ] Permissions to add IAM roles into your AWS account
* [ ] A secret key and access key for your AWS user

=== 2. Steps to deploy Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS

[NOTE]
There are many methods for deploying Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP, this method is the simplest but requires the most permissions. If this method is not appropriate for your AWS environment, please consult the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_creating_connectors_aws.html[NetApp Cloud Documentation^].

==== Deploy the Cloud Manager connector

. Navigate to https://cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^] and login or sign up.
image:cloud_central_login_page.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Once you have logged in, you should be taken to the Canvas
image:cloud_central_canvas_page.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Click on "Add Working Environment" and choose Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS. Here, you will also choose whether you want to deploy a single node system or a high availability pair. I will choose to deploy a high availability pair.
image:cloud_central_add_we.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. If no connector has been created, a pop up will appear that asks you to create a connector
image:cloud_central_add_conn_1.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Click Lets Start and then choose AWS
image:cloud_central_add_conn_3.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Enter your secret key and access key - ensure that your user has the correct permissions outlined on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[NetApp policies page^]
image:cloud_central_add_conn_4.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Give the connector a name and either use a pre-defined role as described on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[NetApp policies page^] or ask Cloud Manager to create the role for you
image:cloud_central_add_conn_5.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Give the networking information of where to deploy the connector. Ensure that outbound internet access is enabled by:
.. Giving the connector a public IP address
.. Giving the connector a proxy to work through
.. Giving the connector a route to the public internet through an Internet Gateway
image:cloud_central_add_conn_6.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Ensure communication with the connector via ssh, http and https by either providing a security group or creating a new security group. I have enabled access to the connector from my IP address only.
image:cloud_central_add_conn_7.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Review the information on the summary page and click Add to deploy the connector
image:cloud_central_add_conn_8.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. The connector will now deploy using a cloud formation stack. You can monitor its progress from Cloud Manager or through AWS.
image:cloud_central_add_conn_9.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. When the deployment is complete, a success page will appear.
image:cloud_central_add_conn_10.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

==== Deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP

. Select AWS and the type of deployment based on your requirements.
image:cloud_central_add_we_1.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. If no subscription has been assigned and you wish to purchase with PAYGO, choose Edit Credentials
image:cloud_central_add_we_2.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose Add Subscription
image:cloud_central_add_we_3.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose the type of contract that you wish to subscribe to. I chose Pay-as-you-go.
image:cloud_central_add_we_4.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. You will be redirected to AWS - choose Continue to Subscribe
image:cloud_central_add_we_5.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Subscribe and you will be redirected back to NetApp Cloud Central. If you have already subscribed and don't get redirected, choose the "click here" link.
image:cloud_central_add_we_6.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. You will be redirected to Cloud Central where you will need to name your subscription and assign it to your Cloud Central account.
image:cloud_central_add_we_7.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. When successful, you will have a check mark page appear. Navigate back to your Cloud Manager tab.
image:cloud_central_add_we_8.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. The subscription will now appear in Cloud Central. Click Apply to continue.
image:cloud_central_add_we_9.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Enter the working environment details such as:
.. Cluster name
.. Cluster password
.. AWS tags (Optional)
image:cloud_central_add_we_10.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose which additional services you would like to deploy. To discover more about these services, visit the https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Homepage^].
image:cloud_central_add_we_11.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose whether to deploy in multiple availability zones (reguires 3 subnets, each in a different AZ), or a single availability zone. I chose multiple AZs.
image:cloud_central_add_we_12.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose the region, VPC and security group for the cluster to be deployed into. In this section, you will also assign the availability zones per node (and mediator) as well as the subnets that they occupy.
image:cloud_central_add_we_13.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose the connection methods for the nodes as well as the mediator.
image:cloud_central_add_we_14.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
[TIP]
The mediator will require communication with the AWS APIs. A public IP address is not required so long as the APIs are reachable once the mediator EC2 instance has been deployed.
. Floating IP addresses are used to allow access to the various IP addresses that Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses including cluster management and data serving IPs. These will need to be addresses that are not already routable within your network and are added to route tables in your AWS environment. These are required to enable consistent IP addresses for an HA pair during failover. More information about floating IP addresses can be found in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/reference_networking_aws.html#requirements-for-ha-pairs-in-multiple-azs[NetApp Cloud Documenation^].
image:cloud_central_add_we_15.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Select which route tables the floating IP addresses will be added to. These route tables will be used by clients to communicate with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
image:cloud_central_add_we_16.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose whether to enable AWS managed encryption or AWS KMS to encrypt ONTAP's root, boot and data disks.
image:cloud_central_add_we_17.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose your licensing model. If you don't know which to choose, please contact your NetApp representative.
image:cloud_central_add_we_18.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Select which configuration best suits your use case. This will be related to the sizing considerations covered in the prerequisites page.
image:cloud_central_add_we_19.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Optionally create a volume. This is not required, as the next steps involve using snapmirror which will create the volumes for us.
image:cloud_central_add_we_20.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Review the selections made and tick the boxes to ensure that you understand that Cloud Manager will deploy resources into your AWS environment. When ready, click Go.
image:cloud_central_add_we_21.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Cloud Volumes ONTAP will now start its deployment process. Cloud Manager uses AWS APIs and cloud formation stacks to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP. It then configures the system to your specifications, giving you a ready-to-go system that can be instantly utilized. The timing for this process will vary depending on the selections made.
image:cloud_central_add_we_22.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. You can monitor the progress by navigating to the Timeline.
image:cloud_central_add_we_23.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. The Timeline acts as an audit of all actions performed in Cloud Manager. You can view all of the API calls that are made by Cloud Manager during setup to both AWS as well as the ONTAP cluster. This can also be effeftively used to troubleshoot any issues that you face.
image:cloud_central_add_we_24.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Once the deployment is complete, the CVO cluster will appear on the canvas and show the current capacity. The ONTAP cluster in its current state is fully configured to allow a true "out of the box" experience.
image:cloud_central_add_we_25.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

==== Configure SnapMirror from on-prem to cloud

Now that you have a source ONTAP system and a destination ONTAP system deployed, you can start to replicate your volumes containing the database data into the cloud.

For a guide on compatible ONTAP versions for SnapMirror, please reference the https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.netapp.doc.pow-dap%2FGUID-0810D764-4CEA-4683-8280-032433B1886B.html[SnapMirror Compatibility Matrix^].

. Click on the source ONTAP system (on-prem) and either drag and drop to the destination, select Replication -> Enable, or select Replication -> Menu -> Replicate
image:cloud_central_replication_1.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
Select Enable
image:cloud_central_replication_2.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
Or Options
image:cloud_central_replication_3.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
Replicate
image:cloud_central_replication_4.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. If you did not drag and drop, choose the destination cluster to replicate to.
image:cloud_central_replication_5.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose the volume that you'd like to replicate. We will replicate the data, and all log volumes.
image:cloud_central_replication_6.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose the destination disk type and tiering policy. For DR, we recommend an SSD as the disk type and to maintain data tiering. Data tiering will tier the mirrored data into low-cost object storage and save you money on the local disks. When you break the relationship or clone the volume, the data will use the local, fast storage.
image:cloud_central_replication_7.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Select the destination volume name - we chose "[source_volume_name]_dr".
image:cloud_central_replication_8.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Select the maximum transfer rate for the replication. This enables you to save bandwidth if you have a low bandwidth connection to the cloud such as a VPN.
image:cloud_central_replication_9.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Definte the replication policy. We chose a Mirror which will will take the most recent dataset and replicate that into the destination volume. You could also choose a different policy based on your requirements.
image:cloud_central_replication_10.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose the schedule for the replication to be triggered by. The recommendation is to set a schedule of "daily" for the data volume and "hourly" for the log volumes, although this can be changed based on requirements.
image:cloud_central_replication_11.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Review the information entered and click "Go" to trigger the cluster peer & SVM peer (if this is your first time replicating between the two clusters) and then implement and initialize the SnapMirror relationship
image:cloud_central_replication_12.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Continue this process for data volumes and log volumes.
. To check all of your relationships, navigate to the Replication tab inside Cloud Manager. Here you can manage your relationships and check on their status.
image:cloud_central_replication_13.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Once all the volumes have been replicated, you are in a steady state and ready to move on to the DR and Dev/Test workflows!

=== 3. Deploy EC2 Compute Instance for Database Workload

AWS has preconfigured ec2 compute instances for various workload. The choice of instance type determines the number of CPU cores,  memory capacity, storage type and capacity, and network performance. For the use cases, with exception of OS partition, the main storage to run database workload is allocated from CVO or FSx ONTAP storage engine. So the main factors to consider are choice of CPU cores, memory, and network performance level. Typical AWS ec2 instance type can be found here: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-2#InstanceTypes:[EC2 Instance Type]

. Select right instance type based on required workload. Factors to consider includes number of business transactions to be supported, number of concurrent users, data sets sizing etc.

. EC2 instance deployment can be launched through EC2 Dashboard. The exact deployment procedures are beyond scope of this solution documentation. Please refer to https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/?trk=ps_a134p000004f2ZGAAY&trkCampaign=acq_paid_search_brand&sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=Google&sc_category=Cloud%20Computing&sc_country=US&sc_geo=NAMER&sc_outcome=acq&sc_detail=%2Bec2%20%2Bcloud&sc_content=EC2%20Cloud%20Compute_bmm&sc_matchtype=b&sc_segment=536455698896&sc_medium=ACQ-P|PS-GO|Brand|Desktop|SU|Cloud%20Computing|EC2|US|EN|Text&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!536455698896!b!!g!!%2Bec2%20%2Bcloud&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIua378M-p8wIVToFQBh0wfQhsEAMYASAAEgKTzvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!536455698896!b!!g!!%2Bec2%20%2Bcloud[Amazon EC2] for details.

. Leverage NetApp Ansible DB automation roles to configure EC2 instance for database DEV/TEST and DR use cases. The automation code can be download from NetApp public GitHub site. https://github.com/NetApp-Automation/na_oracle19c_deploy[Oracle 19c Automated Deployment]. The goal is to install and configure database software stack on EC2 instance to match on-prem OS and database configuration for the use cases.
