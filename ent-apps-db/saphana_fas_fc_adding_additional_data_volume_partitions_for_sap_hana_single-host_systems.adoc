Starting with SAP HANA 2.0 SPS4, additional data volume partitions can be configured. This feature allows you to configure two or more LUNs for the data volume of an SAP HANA tenant database and to scale beyond the size and performance limits of a single LUN.

[NOTE]
It is not necessary to use multiple partitions to fulfil the SAP HANA KPIs. A single LUN with a single partition fulfils the required KPIs.

[NOTE]
Using two or more individual LUNs for the data volume is only available for SAP HANA single-host systems. The SAP storage connector required for SAP HANA multiple-host systems does only support one device for the data volume.

You can add more data volume partitions at any time but it might require a restart of the SAP HANA database.

== Enabling additional data volume partitions

To enable additional data volume partitions, complete the following steps:

. Add the following entry within the `global.ini` file:
+
....
[customizable_functionalities]persistence_datavolume_partition_multipath = true
....

. Restart the database to enable the feature. Adding the parameter through the SAP HANA Studio to the `global.ini` file by using the Systemdb configuration prevents the restart of the database.

== Volume and LUN configuration

The layout of volumes and LUNs is similar to the layout of a single host with one data volume partition, but with an additional data volume and LUN stored on a different aggregate as log volume and the other data volume. The following table shows an example configuration of an SAP HANA single-host systems with two data volume partitions.

|===
|Aggregate 1 at Controller A |Aggregate 2 at Controller A |Aggregate 1 at Controller B |Aggregate 2 at Controller B

|Data volume: SID_data_mnt00001
|Shared volume: SID_shared
|Data volume: SID_data2_mnt00001
|Log volume: SID_log_mnt00001
|===

The next table shows an example of the mount point configuration for a single-host system with two data volume partitions.

|===
|LUN |Mount point at HANA host |Note

|SID_data_mnt00001
|/hana/data/SID/mnt00001
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|SID_data2_mnt00001
|/hana/data2/SID/mnt00001
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|SID_log_mnt00001
|/hana/log/SID/mnt00001
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|SID_shared
|/hana/shared/SID
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|===

Create the new data LUNs by using either ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

== Host configuration

To configure a host, complete the following steps:

. Configure multipathing for the additional LUNs, as described in section 0.
. Create the XFS file system on each additional LUN belonging to the HANA system.
+
....
stlrx300s8-6:/ # mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/hana-SS3_data2_mnt00001
....

. Add the additional file system/s to the `/etc/fstab` configuration file.
+
[NOTE]
The XFS file systems for the data LUN must be mounted with the `relatime` and `inode64` mount options. The XFS file systems for the log LUN must be mounted with the `relatime`, `inode64`, and `nobarrier` mount options.
+
....
stlrx300s8-6:/ # cat /etc/fstab
/dev/mapper/hana-SS3_shared /hana/shared xfs default 0 0
/dev/mapper/hana-SS3_log_mnt00001 /hana/log/SS3/mnt00001 xfs relatime,inode64,nobarrier 0 0
/dev/mapper/hana-SS3_data_mnt00001 /hana/data/SS3/mnt00001 xfs relatime,inode64 0 0/dev/mapper/hana-SS3_data2_mnt00001 /hana/data2/SS3/mnt00001 xfs relatime,inode64 0 0
....

. Create the mount points and set the permissions on the database host.
+
....
stlrx300s8-6:/ # mkdir -p /hana/data2/SS3/mnt00001
stlrx300s8-6:/ # chmod –R 777 /hana/data2/SS3
....

. To mount the file systems, run the `mount –a` command.

== Adding an additional datavolume partition

To add an additional datavolume partition to your tenant database, complete the following step:

. Execute the following SQL statement against the tenant database. Each additional LUN can have a different path.
+
....
ALTER SYSTEM ALTER DATAVOLUME ADD PARTITION PATH '/hana/data2/SID/';
....
