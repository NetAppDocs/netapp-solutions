== VM performance

Selecting the right VM size is important for optimal performance of a relational database in a public cloud. Microsoft recommends that you continue using the same database performance-tuning options that are applicable to SQL Server in on-premises server environments. Use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-memory[memory-optimized^] VM sizes for the best performance of SQL Server workloads. Collect the performance data of existing deployment to identify the RAM and CPU utilization while choosing the right instances. Most deployments choose between the D, E, or M series.

*Notes:*

* For the best performance of SQL Server workloads, use memory-optimized VM sizes.
* NetApp and Microsoft recommend that you identify the storage performance requirements before choosing the instance type with the appropriate memory-to-vCore ratio. This also helps select a lower-instance type with the right network bandwidth to overcome storage throughput limits of the VM.

== VM redundancy

To increase redundancy and high availability, SQL Server VMs should either be in the same https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview[availability set^] or different https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview[availability zones^]. When creating Azure VMs, you must choose between configuring availability sets versus availability zones; an Azure VM cannot participate in both.

== High availability

For high availability, configuring SQL Server AOAG or Always On Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) is the best option. For AOAG, this involves multiple instances of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in a virtual network. If high availability is required at the database level, consider configuring SQL Server availability groups.

== Storage configuration

Microsoft SQL Server can be deployed with an SMB file share as the storage option. Starting with SQL Server 2012, system databases (master, model, msdb, or tempdb), and user databases can be installed with Server Message Block (SMB) file server as a storage option. This applies to both SQL Server stand-alone and SQL Server FCI.

[NOTE]
File share storage for SQL Server databases should support continuously available property. This provides uninterrupted access to the file-share data.

Azure NetApp Files provides high performing file storage to meet any demanding workload, and it reduces SQL Server TCO as compared to block storage solutions. With block storage, VMs have imposed limits on I/O and bandwidth for disk operations; network bandwidth limits alone are applied against Azure NetApp Files. In other words, no VM-level I/O limits are applied to Azure NetApp Files. Without these I/O limits, SQL Server running on smaller VMs connected to Azure NetApp Files can perform as well as SQL Server running on much larger VMs. Azure NetApp Files reduce SQL Server deployment costs by reducing compute and software licensing costs. For detailed cost analysis and performance benefits of using Azure NetApp Files for SQL Server deployment, see the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/solutions-benefits-azure-netapp-files-sql-server[Benefits of using Azure NetApp Files for SQL Server deployment^].

=== Benefits

The benefits of using Azure NetApp Files for SQL Server include the following:

* Using Azure NetApp Files allows you to use smaller instances, thus reducing compute cost.
* Azure NetApp Files also reduces software licensing costs, which reduce the overall TCO.
* Volume reshaping and dynamic service level capability optimizes cost by sizing for steady-state workloads and avoiding overprovisioning.

*Notes:*

* To increase redundancy and high availability, SQL Server VMs should either be in the same https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview[availability set^] or in different https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview[availability zones^].  Consider file path requirements if user-defined data files are required; in which case, select SQL FCI over SQL AOAG.
* The following UNC path is supported: file:///\\ANFSMB-b4ca.anf.test\SQLDB%20and%20\\ANFSMB-b4ca.anf.test\SQLDB\[\\ANFSMB-b4ca.anf.test\SQLDB and \\ANFSMB-b4ca.anf.test\SQLDB\^].
* The loopback UNC path is not supported.
* For sizing, use historic data from your on-premises environment. For OLTP workloads, match the target IOPS with performance requirements using workloads at average and peak times along with the disk reads/sec and disk writes/sec performance counters. For data warehouse and reporting workloads, match the target throughput using workloads at average and peak times and the disk read bytes/sec and disk write bytes/sec. Average values can be used in conjunction with volume reshaping capabilities.

== Create continuously available shares

Create continuously available shares with the Azure portal or Azure CLI. In the portal, select the Enable Continuous Availability property option. for the Azure CLI, specify the share as a continuously available share by using the `az netappfiles volume create with the smb-continuously-avl` option set to `$True`. To learn more about creating a new, continuous availability-enabled volume, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-volumes-smb[Creating a Continuously Available Share^].

*Notes:*

* Enable continuous availability for the SMB volume as shown in the following image.
* If a non-administrator domain account is used, make sure the account has the required security privilege assigned.
* Set the appropriate permissions at the share level and proper file-level permissions.
* A continuously available property cannot be enabled on existing SMB volumes. To convert an existing volume to use a continuously available share, use NetApp Snapshot technology. For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/convert-smb-continuous-availability[Convert existing SMB volumes to use Continuous Availability^].

== Performance

Azure NetApp Files supports three service levels: Standard (16MBps per terabyte), Premium (64MBps per terabyte), and Ultra (128MBps per terabyte). Provisioning the right volume size is important for optimal performance of the database workload. With Azure NetApp Files, volume performance and the throughput limit are based on a combination of the following factors:

* The service level of the capacity pool to which the volume belongs
* The quota assigned to the volume
* The quality of service (QoS) type (auto or manual) of the capacity pool

For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels[Service levels for Azure NetApp Files^].

== Performance validation

As with any deployment, testing the VM and storage is critical. For storage validation, tools such as HammerDB, Apploader, the https://github.com/NetApp/SQL_Storage_Benchmark[SQL Server storage benchmark (SB) tool^], or any custom script or FIO with the appropriate read/write mix should be used. Keep in mind however that most SQL Server workloads, even busy OLTP workloads, are closer to 80%–90% read and 10%–20% write.

To showcase performance, a quick test was performed against a volume using premium service levels. In this test, the volume size was increased from 100GB to 2TB on the fly without any disruption to application access and zero data migration.

Here is another example of real time performance testing with HammerDB performed for the deployment covered in this paper. For this testing, we used a small instance with eight vCPUs, a 500GB Premium SSD, and a 500GB SMB Azure NetApp Files volume. HammerDB was configured with 80 warehouses and eight users.

The following chart shows that Azure NetApp Files was able to deliver 2.6x the number of transactions per minute at 4x lower latency when using a comparable sized volume (500GB).

An additional test was performed by resizing to a larger instance with 32x vCPUs and a 16TB Azure NetApp Files volume. There was a significant increase in transactions per minute with consistent 1ms latency. HammerDB was configured with 80 warehouses and 64 users for this test.

== Cost optimization

Azure NetApp Files allows nondisruptive, transparent volume resizing and the ability to change the service levels with zero downtime and no effect on applications. This is a unique capability allowing dynamic cost management that avoids the need to perform database sizing with peak metrics. Rather, you can use steady state workloads, which avoids upfront costs. The volume reshaping and dynamic service-level change allows you to adjust the bandwidth and service level of Azure NetApp Files volumes on demand almost instantaneously without pausing I/O, while retaining data access.

Azure PaaS offerings such as LogicApp or Functions can be used to easily resize the volume based on a specific webhook or alert rule trigger to meet the workload demands while dynamically handling the cost.

For example, consider a database that needs 250MBps for steady state operation; however, it also requires a peak throughput of 400MBps. In this case, the deployment should be performed with a 4TB volume within the Premium service level to meet the steady-state performance requirements. To handle the peak workload, increase the volume size using Azure functions to 7TB for that specific period, and then downsize the volume to make the deployment cost effective. This configuration avoids overprovisioning of the storage.
