The solutions provide NetApp field and customers with direct instruction and guidance on configuring, operating and migrating databases in a hybrid cloud environment leveraging NetApp SnapCenter GUI tool and NetApp storage service CVO in public cloud, for the following use case(s)

* Database DEV / TEST OPS in Hybrid Cloud
* Database Disaster Recovery in Hybrid Cloud

Today, many enterprise databases are still residing in private corporate data centers for performance, security and/or other reasons. The hybrid cloud database solutions empower enterprises to operate their primary databases on site while leveraging public cloud for DEV/TEST database operation as well as for disaster recovery to reduce licensing and operational costs.

Many enterprise databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, SAP HANA etc. carry very high licensing and operational costs. Many customers pay a perpetual one time license fee as well as annual support cost based on the number of compute cores in their database environment regardless they are for development, test, production purposes, or disaster recovery. Many of those environments might not be fully utilized throughout applications lifecycle.

The solutions provide an option for customers to potentially reduce their licensable cores count by moving their database environments devoted to development or test or disaster recovery to cloud. Leveraging the public cloud scale, redundancy, high availability, as well as consumption based billing model, the cost saving in licensing and operation can be substantial, while not sacrificing any application usability or availability.

Beyond potential database license cost saving, NetApp capacity based CVO license model allows customers save storage cost on the per GB basis while empowering them with many of database manageability, which are none existence from competing storage services. Following is a chart that shows storage cost comparison among popular storage services available in public cloud.

The solutions demonstrate that using NetApp SnapCenter GUI based software tool and NetApp ONTAP Data Fabric SnapMirror, the hybrid cloud databases operations can be easily setup, implemented, and operated as smooth as they can be.

Following short videos demonstrate SnapCenter in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8GPzwjX9CM&list=PLdXI3bZJEw7nofM6lN44eOe4aOSoryckg&index=35[Backup of an Oracle database across a Hybrid Cloud using SnapCenter^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3udynwJlpI[SnapCenter- Clone DEV/TEST to AWS Cloud for an Oracle database^]

It should be point out, although the illustrations through out the document show CVO as a target storage instance in public cloud, the solution is also fully validated on NetApp specific new release of FSx ONTAP storage engine for AWS.

To test drive the solution and use cases for yourself, a NetApp Lab-on-Demand SL10680 can be requested at following link: https://labondemand.netapp.com/lod3/labtest/request?nodeid=68761&destination=lod3/testlabs[TL_AWS_004 HCoD: AWS - NW,SnapCenter(OnPrem)^]
