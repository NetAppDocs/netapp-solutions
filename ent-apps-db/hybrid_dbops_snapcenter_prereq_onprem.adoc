The following tasks must be completed on-premises to prepare the SnapCenter hybrid-cloud database workload environment.

== SnapCenter installation and configuration

The NetApp SnapCenter tool is a Windows-based application that typically runs in a Windows domain environment, although workgroup deployment is also possible. It is based on a multitiered architecture that includes a centralized management server (the SnapCenter server) and a SnapCenter plug-in on the database server hosts for database workloads. Here are a few key considerations for hybrid-cloud deployment.

* *Single instance or HA deployment.* HA deployment provides redundancy in the case of a single SnapCenter instance server failure.
* *Name resolution.* DNS must be configured on the SnapCenter server to resolve all database hosts as well as on the storage SVM for forward and reverse lookup. DNS must also be configured on database servers to resolve the SnapCenter server and the storage SVM for both forward and reverse lookup.
* *Role-based access control (RBAC) configuration.* For mixed database workloads, you might want to use RBAC to segregate management responsibility for different DB platform such as an admin for Oracle database or an admin for SQL Server. Necessary permissions must be granted for the DB admin user.
* *Enable policy-based backup strategy.* To enforce backup consistency and reliability.
* *Open necessary network ports on the firewall.* For the on-premises SnapCenter server to communicate with agents installed in the cloud DB host.
* *Ports must be open to allow SnapMirror traffic between on-prem and public cloud.* The SnapCenter server relies on ONTAP SnapMirror to replicate onsite snapshot backups to cloud CVO storage SVMs.

== On-premises database server storage configuration

Storage performance plays an important role in the overall performance of databases and applications. A well-designed storage layout can not only improve DB performance, but also make it easy to manage database backup and recovery. Several factors should be considered when defining your storage layout, including the size of the database, the rate of expected data change for the database, and the frequency with which you perform backups.

Directly attaching storage LUNs to the guest VM by either NFS or iSCSI for virtualized database workloads generally provides better performance than storage allocated via VMDK. NetApp recommends the storage layout for a large SQL Server database on LUNs depicted in the following figure.

The following figure shows the NetApp recommended storage layout for small or medium SQL Server database on LUNs.

NOTE
the Log directory is dedicated to SnapCenter for transaction log rollup for database recovery. For extra large database, multiple LUNs may be allocated to a volume for better performance.

For Oracle database workload SnapCenter supports database environments backed by ONTAP storage that are mounted to the host as either physical or as virtual devices. You can host the entire database on a single or multiple storage devices based on the criticality of the environment. Typically customers would isolate the data files on a dedicated storage from all other files such as control files, and redo and archive log files. This helps administrators to quickly restore (ONTAP single-file SnapRestore) or clone a large critical database (petabyte scale) using Snapshot technology within few seconds to minutes.

For mission critical workloads that are sensitive to latency, dedicated storage volume should be deployed to different type of Oracle files to achieve best latency possible. For large database,  multiple LUNs (recommended up to 8) per volume should be allocated to data files.

If on the other hand, for smaller Oracle databases, SnapCenter supports shared storage layouts in which you can host multiple databases or part of the databases on the same storage volume or LUN. A quick example of this layout would be that the data files of all the databases hosted on +DATA ASM disk group or volume group and the rest of the files
(redo, archive log, and control files) on another dedicated disk group or volume group (LVM). Such a deployment scenario is illustrated below.

It should be noted that in order to facilitate the relocation of Oracle databases, Oracle binary should be installed on a separate LUN that is included in regular backup policy. This ensures that in the case of database relocation to a new server host, Oracle stack can be started for recovery without any potential issues due to out of sync Oracle binary.

== 3. Licensing Requirements

SnapCenter is licensed software from NetApp. It is generally included in on-prem ONTAP license. However, for hybrid cloud deployment, a cloud license for SnapCenter is also required in order to add CVO to SnapCenter as a target data replication destination. Please review following links for SnapCenter standard capacity-based license for details:

== 4. Networking and Security

== 5. Using Ansible Automation to Sync Up DB Instances between On-prem and Cloud - Optional

To simplify management of hybrid cloud database environment, it is highly recommended but not required to deploy an Ansible controller to automate some of management tasks such as keeping compute instance between on-prem and cloud in sync. This is particular important as out of sync compute instance in cloud with on-prem might render the recovered database in cloud error prone because of missing kernel package etc.

The automation capability of Ansible controller also could be used to argument SnapCenter for certain tasks such as breaking up the snapmirror to activate the DR data copy for production.
