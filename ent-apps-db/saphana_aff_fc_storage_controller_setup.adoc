This section describes the configuration of the NetApp storage system. You must complete the primary installation and setup according to the corresponding Data ONTAP setup and configuration guides.

== Storage efficiency

Inline deduplication, cross-volume inline deduplication, inline compression, and inline compaction are supported with SAP HANA in an SSD configuration.

== NetApp Volume Encryption

The use of NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) is supported with SAP HANA.

== Quality of service

QoS can be used to limit the storage throughput for specific SAP HANA systems or no- SAP applications on a shared-use controller. One use case would be to limit the throughput of development and test systems so that they cannot influence production systems in a mixed setup.

During the sizing process, you should determine the performance requirements of a nonproduction system. Development and test systems can be sized with lower performance values, typically in the range of 20% to 50% of a production-system KPI as defined by SAP.

Starting with ONTAP 9, QoS is configured on the storage volume level and uses maximum values for throughput (MBps) and the amount of I/O (IOPS).

Large write I/O has the biggest performance effect on the storage system. Therefore, the QoS throughput limit should be set to a percentage of the corresponding write SAP HANA storage performance KPI values in the data and log volumes.

=== NetApp FabricPool

NetApp FabricPool technology must not be used for active primary file systems in SAP HANA systems. This includes the file systems for the data and log area as well as the `/hana/shared` file system. Doing so results in unpredictable performance, especially during the startup of an SAP HANA system.

You can use the Snapshot-Only tiering policy along with FabricPool at a backup target such as SnapVault or SnapMirror destination.

[NOTE]
Using FabricPool for tiering Snapshot copies at primary storage or using FabricPool at a backup target changes the required time for the restore and recovery of a database or other tasks such as creating system clones or repair systems. Take this into consideration for planning your overall lifecycle-management strategy, and check to make sure that your SLAs are still being met while using this function.

FabricPool is a good option for moving log backups to another storage tier. Moving backups affects the time needed to recover an SAP HANA database. Therefore, the option `tiering-minimum-cooling-days` should be set to a value that places log backups, which are routinely needed for recovery, on the local fast storage tier.

== Configure storage

The following overview summarizes the required storage configuration steps. Each step is covered in more detail in the subsequent sections. In this section, we assume that the storage hardware is set up and that the ONTAP software is already installed. Also, the connection of the storage FCP ports to the SAN fabric must already be in place.

. Check the correct disk shelf configuration, as described in "disk_shelf_connection."
. Create and configure the required aggregates, as described in xref "aggregate_configuration."
. Create a storage virtual machine (SVM), as described in "storage_virtual_machine_configuration."
. Create logical interfaces (LIFs), as described in "logical_interface_configuration."
. Create a port set, as described in "fcp_port_sets."
. Create initiator groups, volumes, and LUNs within the aggregates, as described in creating "luns_and_volumes_and_mapping_LUNs_to_initiator_groups."

== Disk shelf connection

=== SAS-based disk shelves

A maximum of one disk shelf can be connected to one SAS stack to provide the required performance for the SAP HANA hosts, as shown in the following figure. The disks within each shelf must be distributed equally between both controllers of the HA pair. ADPv2 is used with ONTAP 9 and the new DS224C disk shelves.

[NOTE]
With the DS224C disk shelf, quad-path SAS cabling can also be used but is not required.

=== NVMe(100GbE)-based disk shelves

Each NS224 NVMe desk shelf is connected with two 100GbE ports per controller, as shown in the following figure. The disks within each shelf must be distributed equally to both controllers of the HA pair. ADPv2 is also used for the NS224 disk shelf.

image:saphana_aff_fc_image11.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

== Aggregate configuration

In general, you must configure two aggregates per controller, independent of which disk shelf or disk technology (SSD or HDD) is used. This step is necessary so that you can use all available controller resources. For AFF A200 series systems, one data aggregate is sufficient.

The following figure shows a configuration of 12 SAP HANA hosts running on a 12Gb SAS shelf configured with ADPv2. Six SAP HANA hosts are attached to each storage controller. Four separate aggregates, two at each storage controller, are configured. Each aggregate is configured with 11 disks with nine data and two parity disk partitions. For each controller, two spare partitions are available.

image:saphana_aff_fc_image12.jpg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

== Storage virtual machine configuration

Multiple SAP landscapes with SAP HANA databases can use a single SVM. An SVM can also be assigned to each SAP landscape, if necessary, in case they are managed by different teams within a company.

If there is a QoS profile automatically created and assigned while creating a new SVM, remove this automatically created profile from the SVM to ensure the required performance for SAP HANA:

....
vserver modify -vserver <svm-name> -qos-policy-group none
....

== Logical interface configuration

Within the storage cluster configuration, one network interface (LIF) must be created and assigned to a dedicated FCP port. If, for example, four FCP ports are required for performance reasons, four LIFs must be created. The following figure shows a screenshot of the eight LIFs (named `fc_*_*`) that were configured on the `hana` SVM.

image:saphana_aff_fc_image13.jpeg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

During the SVM creation with ONTAP 9.8 System Manager, you can select all of the required physical FCP ports, and one LIF per physical port is created automatically.

image:saphana_aff_fc_image14.jpeg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

== FCP port sets

An FCP port set is used to define which LIFs are to be used by a specific initiator group. Typically, all LIFs created for the HANA systems are placed in the same port set. The following figure shows the configuration of a port set named 32g that includes the four LIFs that were already created.

image:saphana_aff_fc_image15.jpeg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[NOTE]
With ONTAP 9.8,  a port set is not required,  but it can be created and used through the command line.

== Volume and LUN configuration for SAP HANA single-host systems

The following figure shows the volume configuration of four single-host SAP HANA systems. The data and log volumes of each SAP HANA system are distributed to different storage controllers. For example, volume `SID1_data_mnt00001` is configured on controller A, and volume `SID1_log_mnt00001` is configured on controller B. Within each volume, a single LUN is configured.

[NOTE]
If only one storage controller of a HA pair is used for the SAP HANA systems, data volumes and log volumes can also be stored on the same storage controller.

image:saphana_aff_fc_image16.jpg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

For each SAP HANA host, a data volume, a log volume, and a volume for `/hana/shared` are configured. The following table shows an example configuration with four SAP HANA single-host systems.

|===
|Purpose |Aggregate 1 at Controller A |Aggregate 2 at Controller A |Aggregate 1 at Controller B |Aggregate 2 at Controller B

|Data, log, and shared volumes for system SID1
|Data volume: SID1_data_mnt00001
|Shared volume: SID1_shared
|–
|Log volume: SID1_log_mnt00001
|Data, log, and shared volumes for system SID2

The following table shows an example of the mount point configuration for a single-host system.

|===
|LUN |Mount point at SAP HANA host |Note

|SID1_data_mnt00001
|/hana/data/SID1/mnt00001

|SID1_log_mnt00001
|/hana/log/SID1/mnt00001
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|SID1_shared
|/hana/shared/SID1
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|===

[NOTE]
With the described configuration, the `/usr/sap/SID1` directory in which the default home directory of user SID1adm is stored, is on the local disk. In a disaster recovery setup with disk-based replication, NetApp recommends creating an additional LUN within the `SID1_shared` volume for the `/usr/sap/SID1` directory so that all file systems are on the central storage.

== Volume and LUN configuration for SAP HANA single-host systems using Linux LVM

The Linux LVM can be used to increase performance and to address LUN size limitations. The different LUNs of an LVM volume group should be stored within a different aggregate and at a different controller. The following table shows an example for two LUNs per volume group.

[NOTE]
It is not necessary to use LVM with multiple LUNs to fulfill the SAP HANA KPIs. A single LUN setup fulfills the required KPIs.

|===
|Purpose |Aggregate 1 at Controller A |Aggregate 2 at Controller A |Aggregate 1 at Controller B |Aggregate 2 at Controller B

|Data, log, and shared volumes for LVM based system
|Data volume: SID1_data_mnt00001
|Shared volume: SID1_shared
Log2 volume: SID1_log2_mnt00001
|Data2 volume: SID1_data2_mnt00001
|Log volume: SID1_log_mnt00001
|===

At the SAP HANA host, volume groups and logical volumes need to be created and mounted, as indicated in the following table.

|===
|Logical volume/LUN |Mount point at SAP HANA host |Note

|LV: SID1_data_mnt0000-vol
|/hana/data/SID1/mnt00001
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|LV: SID1_log_mnt00001-vol
|/hana/log/SID1/mnt00001
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|LUN: SID1_shared
|/hana/shared/SID1
|Mounted using /etc/fstab entry
|===

[NOTE]
With the described configuration, the `/usr/sap/SID1` directory in which the default home directory of user SID1adm is stored, is on the local disk. In a disaster recovery setup with disk-based replication, NetApp recommends creating an additional LUN within the `SID1_shared` volume for the `/usr/sap/SID1` directory so that all file systems are on the central storage.

== Volume and LUN configuration for SAP HANA multiple-host systems

The following figure shows the volume configuration of a 4+1 multiple-host SAP HANA system. The data volumes and log volumes of each SAP HANA host are distributed to different storage controllers. For example, the volume `SID_data_mnt00001` is configured on controller A and the volume `SID_log_mnt00001` is configured on controller B. One LUN is configured within each volume.

The `/hana/shared` volume must be accessible by all HANA hosts and is therefore exported by using NFS. Even though there are no specific performance KPIs for the `/hana/shared` file system, NetApp recommends using a 10Gb Ethernet connection.

[NOTE]
If only one storage controller of an HA pair is used for the SAP HANA system, data and log volumes can also be stored on the same storage controller.

[NOTE]
NetApp ASA AFF systems do not support NFS as a protocol. NetApp recommends using an additional AFF or FAS system for the `/hana/shared` file system.

image:saphana_aff_fc_image17.jpg[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

For each SAP HANA host, a data volume and a log volume are created. The `/hana/shared` volume is used by all hosts of the SAP HANA system. The following table shows an example configuration for a 4+1 multiple-host SAP HANA system.

|===
|Purpose |Aggregate 1 at Controller A |Aggregate 2 at Controller A |Aggregate 1 at Controller B |Aggregate 2 at Controller B

|/hana/log/SID/mnt00004
|Mounted using storage connector
|Volume: SID_shared
|/hana/shared
|Mounted at all hosts using NFS and /etc/fstab entry
|===

[NOTE]
With the described configuration, the `/usr/sap/SID` directory in which the default home directory of user SIDadm is stored, is on the local disk for each HANA host. In a disaster recovery setup with disk-based replication, NetApp recommends creating four additional subdirectories in the `SID_shared` volume for the `/usr/sap/SID` file system so that each database host has all its file systems on the central storage.

== Volume and LUN configuration for SAP HANA multiple-host systems using Linux LVM

The Linux LVM can be used to increase performance and to address LUN size limitations. The different LUNs of an LVM volume group should be stored within a different aggregate and at a different controller.

[NOTE]
It is not necessary to use LVM to combine several LUN to fulfill the SAP HANA KPIs. A single LUN setup fulfills the required KPIs.

The following table shows an example for two LUNs per volume group for a 2+1 SAP HANA multiple host system.

|===
|Purpose |Aggregate 1 at Controller A |Aggregate 2 at Controller A |Aggregate 1 at Controller B |Aggregate 2 at Controller B

|Data and log volumes for node 1
|Data volume: SID_data_mnt00001
|Log2 volume: SID_log2_mnt00001

|Data volume: SID_data_mnt00002
|Data2 volume: SID_data2_mnt00002
|Log volume: SID_log_mnt00002
|Shared volume for all hosts
|Shared volume: SID_shared

At the SAP HANA host, volume groups and logical volumes need to be created and mounted, as indicated in the following table.

|===
|Logical volume (LV) or volume |Mount point at SAP HANA host |Note

|LV: SID_data_mnt00001-vol
|/hana/data/SID/mnt00001

|/hana/log/SID/mnt00002
|Mounted using storage connector
|Volume: SID_shared
|/hana/shared
|Mounted at all hosts using NFS and /etc/fstab entry
|===

[NOTE]
With the described configuration, the `/usr/sap/SID` directory in which the default home directory of user SIDadm is stored, is on the local disk for each HANA host. In a disaster recovery setup with disk-based replication, NetApp recommends creating four additional subdirectories in the `SID_shared` volume for the `/usr/sap/SID` file system so that each database host has all its file systems on the central storage.

== Volume options

The volume options listed in the following table must be verified and set on all SVMs.

|===
|Action |

|Disable automatic Snapshot copies
|vol modify –vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volname> -snapshot-policy none
|Disable visibility of Snapshot directory
|vol modify -vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volname> -snapdir-access false
|===

=== Creating LUNs, volumes, and mapping LUNs to initiator groups

You can use NetApp ONTAP System Manager to create storage volumes and LUNs and map them to the servers.

NetApp offers an automated application wizard for SAP HANA within ONTAP System Manager 9.7 and earlier, which simplifies the volume and LUN provisioning process significantly. It creates and configures the volumes and LUNs automatically according to NetApp best practices for SAP HANA.

Using the `sanlun` tool, run the following command to obtain the worldwide port names (WWPNs) of each SAP HANA host:

....
stlrx300s8-6:~ # sanlun fcp show adapter
/sbin/udevadm
/sbin/udevadm
host0 ...... WWPN:2100000e1e163700
host1 ...... WWPN:2100000e1e163701
....

[NOTE]
The `sanlun` tool is part of the NetApp Host Utilities and must be installed on each SAP HANA host. For more information, see the section "host_setup."

The following steps show the configuration of a 2+1 multiple-host HANA system with the SID SS3:

. Start the Application Provisioning wizard for SAP HANA in System Manager and provide the required information. All initiators (WWPNs) from all hosts must be added.
+
