Certain prerequisites needs to be configured at both on-prem and cloud before any actual hybrid cloud database workload execution. Following provide a high level summary and the details of the prerequisites configuration can be drilled down as needed through the attached links.

== On Premises

=== 1. Setup Database Admin User in SnapCenter

NetApp SnapCenter tool utilizes role based access control (RBAC) for managing user resources access and permission grants. There are prepopulated roles after SnapCenter installation. Custom roles can be created as well based on user needs or applications. It makes sense to have a dedicated admin user ID for each database platform supported by SnapCenter for database backup and recovery, disaster recovery. Some may also choose to use a single ID to manage all databases. In our test cases, we have created an dedicated admin user for Oracle and SQL Server respectively.

Certain SnapCenter resources can only be provisioned with SnapCenterAdmin role. Then resources can be assigned to other user IDs for access.

In a pre installed and configured on-prem SnapCenter environment, following tasks may already have being done. If not, following are steps to create database admin user:

. Add the admin user to windows active directory
. Login to SnapCenter using a ID granted with SnapCenterAdmin role
. Go to Setting and Users and Access tab, click on Add button to add new user. The new user id will be linked to admin user created in windows active directory in step 1. Assign proper role to the user as needed. Assign resources to admin user as applicable.

=== 2. SnapCenter Plugin Installation Prerequisites

SnapCenter performs its backup, restore, clone etc. functions via a plugin agent running on DB hosts. It connects to database host and database via credential configured under Setting and Credentials tab for plugin istallation and other management functions. There are specific privileges requirements for Linux or Windows user based on target host and database type.

Generally, you want to use an administrator user accounts on the host as your host connection credentials for plugin installation. You can also grant the same user for database access using OS based authentication. On the other hand, you can also use different database user ID for DB management access. If you decided to use OS based authentication, the OS admin user ID must be granted DB access. For Windows domain based SQL Server installation, an domain admin account can be used to manage all SQL Server within the domain.

. Windows host for SQL server:
.. If you are using Windows credentials for authentication, you must set up your credential before installing plug-ins.
.. If you are using an SQL Server instance for authentication, you must add the credential after installing plug-ins.
.. If you have enabled SQL authentication while setting up the credentials, the discovered instance or database is shown with a red color lock icon. If the lock icon appears, you must specify the instance or database credentials to successfully add the instance or database to a resource group.
.. You must assign the credential to a role-based access control (RBAC) user without sysadmin access when the following conditions are met:
... The credential is assigned to an SQL instance.
... The SQL instance or host is assigned to an RBAC user.
... The RBAC DB admin user must have both the resource group and backup privileges.

. Unix host for Oracle:
.. You must have enabled the password-based SSH connection for the root or non-root user by editing sshd.conf and restart sshd service. The password-based SSH authentication on AWS instance by default is turned off.
.. Configure the sudo privileges for the non-root user to install and start the plug-in process. After installing the plug-in, the processes will be running as an effective root user.
.. Create credentials with authentication mode as Linux for the install user.
.. You must have installed Java 1.8.x, 64-bit, on your Linux host.
.. Installation of Oracle database plugin will also install SnapCenter plugin for Unix.

=== 3. SnapCenter Host Plugin Installation

Following steps illustrate how a database host is added to SnapCenter while a SnapCenter plugin is installed on the host. The procedure applies to both adding on-prem hosts and adding cloud hosts. Following demonstrates adding a Windows or a Linux host residing in AWS.

==== Add Windows host and installation of plugin on the host:
. Login to SnapCenter as an user ID with SnapCenterAdmin privilege
. Click on Hosts tab from left side menu list, then click on Add to open add host workflow
. Choose Windows for Host Type, Host Name can be either host name or IP address, however host name must be resolved to correct host IP address from SnapCenter host. Choose host credentials created in step 2. Choose Microsoft Windows and Microsoft SQL Server as the plugin packages to be installed

image:snapctr_add_windows_host_01.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[start=4]
. After plugin is installed on a Windows host, its Overall Status is showing as "Configure log directory".

[start=6]
. Click on "Configure log directory" to open "Configure Plug-in for SQL Server"

image:snapctr_add_windows_host_04.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[start=7]
. Click on Browse to discover the NetApp storage that a log directory can be set. SnapCenter use this log directory to rollup the SQL server transaction log files, then click on Save.

image:snapctr_add_windows_host_05.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[start=8]
. After log directory is configured, the Windows host plugin Overall Status is changed to Running.

image:snapctr_add_windows_host_06.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[start=9]
. Assign the host to database management user ID - navigating to Settings and Users and Access tab, click on the user ID that the host needs to be assigned to, click Save to complete the host resource assignment

image:snapctr_add_windows_host_07.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
image:snapctr_add_windows_host_08.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

==== Add Unix host and installation of plugin on the host:
. Login to SnapCenter as an user ID with SnapCenterAdmin privilege
. Click on Hosts tab from left side menu list, then click on Add to open add host workflow
. Choose Linux as Host Type, Host Name can be either host name or IP address, however host name must be resolved to correct host IP address from SnapCenter host. Choose host credentials created in step 2. The host Credential needs sudo privilege. Check Oracle Database as the Plug-ins to be installed, which would install both Oracle and Linux host plugins.

image:snapctr_add_linux_host_01.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[start=4]
. Click on more options and check "Skip preinstall checks". You will be prompted to confirm skipping of preinstall check, click on Yes to skip and Save.

image:snapctr_add_linux_host_02.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[start=5]
. Click on Submit to start plugin installation, you will be prompted to Confirm Fingerprint as shown below.

image:snapctr_add_linux_host_03.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[start=6]
. SnapCenter first performs host validation, registration and then the plugin is installed on Linux host. The Overall Status will be transitioned from Installing plugin in to running status.

image:snapctr_add_linux_host_04.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

[start=7]
. Assign the newly added host to proper database management user ID

image:snapctr_add_linux_host_05.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
image:snapctr_add_linux_host_06.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

=== 4. DB Resource Discovery

With successful plugin installation, the database resources on the host can be immediately discovered. Click on Resources tab on the left side menu. Depending on the type of database platform, number of views are available such as database, resources group etc. You may need to click on Refresh Resources tab if the resources on the host somehow is not discovered and displayed.

image:snapctr_resources_ora.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

When its initially discovered, the database Overall Status shows as "Not protected". The above screen shot an Oracle database not protected as yet by a backup policy.

When backup configuration or policy is setup and a backup has been executed, the database Overall Status will show the backup status such as "Backup succeeded" and timestamp of last backup. Below screen shot shows the backup status of a SQL Server user database.

image:snapctr_resources_sql.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

If the database access credential is not properly setup, a red lock button indicates that database is not accessible such as a Windows credential does not have sysadmin access to database instance, database credential needs to be reconfigured to unlock the red lock.

image:snapctr_add_windows_host_09.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
image:snapctr_add_windows_host_10.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

After appropriate credential is configured either at Windows level or database level, the SQL Server Type information is gathered and reviewed.

image:snapctr_add_windows_host_11.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

=== 5. Setup Storage Cluster Peering and DB Volumes Replication

To protect your on-prem database data using public cloud as target destination, on-prem ONTAP cluster database volumes are replicated to cloud CVO using NetApp snapmirror technology. The replicated target volumes then can be cloned for DEV/OPS or disaster recovery. Here are high level steps to setup the cluster peering and DB volumes replication.

. Configure inter-cluster lifs for cluster Peering on both on-prem cluster and CVO cluster instance. This can be done through ONTAP System Manger. A default CVO deployment will have inter-cluster lifs configured automatically.

on-prem cluster:

== Public Cloud

[NOTE]
To make things easier to follow, we have created this document based on a deployment in AWS, however the process is very similar in Azure and GCP too.

=== Pre-flight check

Before deploying anything, ensure that the infrastructure is in place to allow for the deployment in the next stage. This includes:

[%interactive]
* [ ] AWS account
* [ ] VPC in your region of choice
* [ ] Subnet with access to the public internet
* [ ] Permissions to add IAM roles into your AWS account
* [ ] A secret key and access key for your AWS user
