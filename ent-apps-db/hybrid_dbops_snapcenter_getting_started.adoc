Certain prerequisites needs to be configured at both on-prem and cloud before any actual hybrid cloud database workload execution. Following provide a high level summary and the details of the prerequisites configuration can be drilled down as needed through the attached links.

== On Premises

=== 1. Setup Database Admin User in SnapCenter

NetApp SnapCenter tool utilizes role based access control (RBAC) for managing user access and permission grants. There are prepopulated roles after SnapCenter installation. Custom roles can be created as well based on user needs or applications. It makes sense to have a dedicated admin user ID for each database platform supported by SnapCenter for database backup and recovery, disaster recovery. Some may also choose to use a single ID to manage all databases. In our test cases, we have created an dedicated admin user for Oracle and SQL Server respectively.

In a pre installed and configured on-prem SnapCenter environment, following tasks may already have being done. If not, following are steps to create database admin user:

. Add the admin user to windows active directory
. Login to SnapCenter using a ID granted with SnapCenterAdmin role
. Go to Setting and Users and Access tab, click on Add button to add new user. The new user id will be linked to admin user created in windows active directory in step 1. Assign proper role to the user as needed. Assign resources to admin user as applicable.

=== 2. Create Host Credentials for DB Host and DB Access

SnapCenter connect to database host and database via credential configured under Setting and Credentials tab. There are specific privileges requirements for Linux or Windows user based on target host type.

. Windows host for SQL server:
.. If you are using Windows credentials for authentication, you must set up your credential before installing plug-ins.
.. If you are using an SQL Server instance for authentication, you must add the
credential after installing plug-ins.
.. If you have enabled SQL authentication while setting up the credentials, the discovered instance or database is shown with a red color lock icon. If the lock icon appears, you must specify the instance or database credentials to successfully add the instance or database to a resource group.
.. You must assign the credential to a role-based access control (RBAC) user without sysadmin access when the following conditions are met:
... The credential is assigned to an SQL instance.
... The SQL instance or host is assigned to an RBAC user.

.. The user must have both the resource group and backup privileges.

. Unix host for Oracle:
..

Following graphic shows NetApp recommended storage layout for small or medium SQL Server database on LUNs:

image:storage_layout_sqlsvr_smallmedium.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

Note: the Log directory is dedicated to SnapCenter for transaction log rollup for database recovery. For extra large database, multiple LUNs may be allocated to a volume for better performance.

For Oracle database workload SnapCenter supports database environments backed by ONTAP storage that are mounted to the host as either physical or as virtual devices. You can host the entire database on a single or multiple storage devices based on the criticality of the environment. Typically customers would isolate the data files on a dedicated storage from all other files such as control files, and redo and archive log files. This helps administrators to quickly restore (ONTAP single-file SnapRestore) or clone a large critical database (petabyte scale) using Snapshot technology within few seconds to minutes.

image:storage_layout_oracle_typical.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

For mission critical workloads that are sensitive to latency, dedicated storage volume should be deployed to different type of Oracle files to achieve best latency possible. For large database,  multiple LUNs (recommended up to 8) per volume should be allocated to data files.

image:storage_layout_oracle_dedicated.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

If on the other hand, for smaller Oracle databases, SnapCenter supports shared storage layouts in which you can host multiple databases or part of the databases on the same storage volume or LUN. A quick example of this layout would be that the data files of all the databases hosted on +DATA ASM disk group or volume group and the rest of the files
(redo, archive log, and control files) on another dedicated disk group or volume group (LVM). Such a deployment scenario is illustrated below.

image:storage_layout_oracle_shared.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

It should be noted that in order to facilitate the relocation of Oracle databases, Oracle binary should be installed on a separate LUN that is included in regular backup policy. This ensures that in the case of database relocation to a new server host, Oracle stack can be started for recovery without any potential issues due to out of sync Oracle binary.

=== 3. Licensing Requirements

SnapCenter is licensed software from NetApp. It is generally included in on-prem ONTAP license. However, for hybrid cloud deployment, a cloud license for SnapCenter is also required in order to add CVO to SnapCenter as a target data replication destination. Please review following links for SnapCenter standard capacity-based license for details:

link:https://https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/install/concept_snapcenter_standard_capacity_based_licenses.html[SnapCenter standard capacity-based licenses^]

=== 4. Networking and Security

=== 5. Using Ansible Automation to Sync Up DB Instances between On-prem and Cloud - Optional

To simplify management of hybrid cloud database environment, it is highly recommended but not required to deploy an Ansible controller to automate some of management tasks such as keeping compute instance between on-prem and cloud in sync. This is particular important as out of sync compute instance in cloud with on-prem might render the recovered database in cloud error prone because of missing kernel package etc.

The automation capability of Ansible controller also could be used to argument SnapCenter for certain tasks such as breaking up the snapmirror to activate the DR data copy for production.

== Public Cloud

[NOTE]
To make things easier to follow, we have created this document based on a deployment in AWS, however the process is very similar in Azure and GCP too.

=== Pre-flight check

Before deploying anything, ensure that the infrastructure is in place to allow for the deployment in the next stage. This includes:

[%interactive]
* [ ] AWS account
* [ ] VPC in your region of choice
* [ ] Subnet with access to the public internet
* [ ] Permissions to add IAM roles into your AWS account
* [ ] A secret key and access key for your AWS user

=== Steps to deploy Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS

[NOTE]
There are many methods for deploying Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP, this method is the simplest but requires the most permissions. If this method is not appropriate for your AWS environment, please consult the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_creating_connectors_aws.html[NetApp Cloud Documentation^].

image:cloud_central_add_we_11.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose whether to deploy in multiple availability zones (reguires 3 subnets, each in a different AZ), or a single availability zone. I chose multiple AZs.
image:cloud_central_add_we_12.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose the region, VPC and security group for the cluster to be deployed into. In this section, you will also assign the availability zones per node (and mediator) as well as the subnets that they occupy.
image:cloud_central_add_we_13.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose the connection methods for the nodes as well as the mediator.
image:cloud_central_add_we_14.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
[TIP]
The mediator will require communication with the AWS APIs. A public IP address is not required so long as the APIs are reachable once the mediator EC2 instance has been deployed.
. Floating IP addresses are used to allow access to the various IP addresses that Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses including cluster management and data serving IPs. These will need to be addresses that are not already routable within your network and are added to route tables in your AWS environment. These are required to enable consistent IP addresses for an HA pair during failover. More information about floating IP addresses can be found in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/reference_networking_aws.html#requirements-for-ha-pairs-in-multiple-azs[NetApp Cloud Documenation^].
image:cloud_central_add_we_15.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Select which route tables the floating IP addresses will be added to. These route tables will be used by clients to communicate with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
image:cloud_central_add_we_16.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose whether to enable AWS managed encryption or AWS KMS to encrypt ONTAP's root, boot and data disks.
image:cloud_central_add_we_17.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Choose your licensing model. If you don't know which to choose, please contact your NetApp representative.
image:cloud_central_add_we_18.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Select which configuration best suits your use case. This will be related to the sizing considerations covered in the prerequisites page.
image:cloud_central_add_we_19.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Optionally create a volume. This is not required, as the next steps involve using snapmirror which will create the volumes for us.
image:cloud_central_add_we_20.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Review the selections made and tick the boxes to ensure that you understand that Cloud Manager will deploy resources into your AWS environment. When ready, click Go.
image:cloud_central_add_we_21.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Cloud Volumes ONTAP will now start its deployment process. Cloud Manager uses AWS APIs and cloud formation stacks to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP. It then configures the system to your specifications, giving you a ready-to-go system that can be instantly utilized. The timing for this process will vary depending on the selections made.
image:cloud_central_add_we_22.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. You can monitor the progress by navigating to the Timeline.
image:cloud_central_add_we_23.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. The Timeline acts as an audit of all actions performed in Cloud Manager. You can view all of the API calls that are made by Cloud Manager during setup to both AWS as well as the ONTAP cluster. This can also be effeftively used to troubleshoot any issues that you face.
image:cloud_central_add_we_24.PNG[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
. Once the deployment is complete, the CVO cluster will appear on the canvas and show the current capacity. The ONTAP cluster in its current state is fully configured to allow a true "out of the box" experience.
