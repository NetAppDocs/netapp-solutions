== Cloud Insights

NetApp Cloud Insights is a web-based monitoring tool that gives you complete visibility into infrastructure and applications running on NetApp and other third-party infrastructure components. Cloud Insights supports both private cloud and public clouds for monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing resources.

Only the acquisition unit VM (can be Windows or Linux) must be installed on a private cloud to collect metrics from data collectors without the need for agents. Agent-based data collectors allow you to pull custom metrics from Windows Performance Monitor or any input agents that Telegraf supports.

The following figure depicts the Cloud Insights VDS dashboard.
