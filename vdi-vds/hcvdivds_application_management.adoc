Task workers can quickly launch an application from the list of applications made available to them. App services publish applications from the Remote Desktop Services session hosts. With WVD, App Groups provide similar functionality from multi-session Windows 10 host pools.

For office workers to power users, the applications that they require can be provisioned manually using a service board, or they can be auto-provisioned using the scripted events feature in NetApp VDS.
