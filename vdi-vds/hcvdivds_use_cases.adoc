Hybrid VDI with NetApp VDS allows service providers and enterprise virtual desktop administrators to easily expand resources to other cloud environment without affecting their users. Having on-premises resources provides better control of resources and offers wide selection of choices (compute, GPU, storage, and network) to meet demand.

This solution applies to the following use cases:

* Bursting into the cloud for surges in demand for remote desktops and applications
* Reducing TCO for long running remote desktops and applications by hosting them on-premises with flash storage and GPU resources
* Ease of management of remote desktops and applications across cloud environments
* Experience remote desktops and applications by using a software-as-a- service model with on-premises resources

== Target Audience

The target audience for the solution includes the following groups:

* EUC/VDI architects who wants to understand the requirements for a hybrid VDS
* NetApp partners who would like to assist customers with their remote desktop and application needs
* Existing NetApp HCI customers who want to address remote desktop and application demands
