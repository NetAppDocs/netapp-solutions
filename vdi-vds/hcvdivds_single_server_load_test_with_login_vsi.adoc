summary: With NetApp VDS, administrators can delegate tasks to others. They can connect to deployed servers to troubleshoot, view logs, and run audit reports. While assisting customers, helpdesk or level-3 technicians can shadow user sessions, view process lists, and kill processes if required.

The NetApp Virtual Desktop Service uses the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol to access virtual desktop sessions and applications, and the Login VSI tool determines the maximum number of users that can be hosted on a specific server model. Login VSI simulates user login at specific intervals and performs user operations like opening documents, reading and composing mails, working with Excel and PowerPoint, printing documents, compressing files, and taking random breaks. It then measures response times. User response time is low when server utilization is low and  increases when more user sessions are added. Login VSI determines the baseline based on initial user login sessions and it reports the maximum user session when the user response exceeds 2 seconds from the baseline.

NetApp Virtual Desktop Service utilizes Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol to access the Virtual Desktop session and Applications. To determine the maximum number of users that can be hosted on a specific server model, we used the Login VSI tool. Login VSI simulates user login at specific intervals and performs user operations like opening documents, reading and composing mails, working with Excel and PowerPoint, printing documents, compressing files, taking random breaks, and so on. It also measures response times. User response time is low when server utilization is low and increases when more user sessions are added. Login VSI determines the baseline based on the initial user login sessions and it reports maximum user sessions when the user response exceeds 2sec from the baseline.

The following table contains the hardware used for this validation.

Considering sub-NUMA boundaries and hyperthreading, the eight VMs chosen for VM testing and configuration depended on the cores available on the host.

We used 10 launcher VMs on the H610C, which used the RDP protocol to connect to the user session. The following figure depicts the Login VSI connection information.
