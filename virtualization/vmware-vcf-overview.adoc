[.lead]
VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is a set of technologies that provides a straightforward path to accessing a hybrid cloud experience. Within the VCF solution, support is provided for both native Kubernetes and virtual machine based workloads. Essential services like VMware vSphere, VMware vSAN, VMware NSX-T Data Center, and VMware vRealize Cloud Management are integral components of the VCF package. When combined, these services establish a software-defined infrastructure capable of managing compute, storage, networking, security, and cloud management. This collective infrastructure provides a hybrid experience, wherein the VCF framework extends the environment from onsite data center to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud.
