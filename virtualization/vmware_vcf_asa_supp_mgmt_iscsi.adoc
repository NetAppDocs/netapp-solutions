== Use ONTAP Tools to configure supplemental storage for VCF Management Domains

=== Scenario Overview
In this scenario we will demonstrate how to deploy and use ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere (OTV) to configure an iSCSI datastore for a VCF management domain.

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Create a storage virtual machine (SVM) with logical interfaces (LIFs) for iSCSI traffic.
* Create distributed port groups for iSCSI networks on the VCF management domain.
* Create vmkernel adapters for iSCSI on the ESXi hosts for the VCF management domain.
* Deploy ONTAP Tools on the VCF management domain.
* Create a new VMFS datastore on the VCF management domain.

=== Prerequisites
This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* An ONTAP ASA storage system with physical data ports on ethernet switches dedicated to storage traffic.
* VCF management domain deployment is complete and the vSphere client is accessible.

NetApp recommends fully redundant network designs for iSCSI. The following diagram illustrates an example of a redundant configuration, providing fault tolerance for storage systems, switches, networks adapters and host systems. Refer to the NetApp link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-config/index.html[SAN configuration reference] for additional information.

{nbsp}

For multipathing and failover across multiple paths, NetApp recommends having a minimum of two LIFs per storage node in separate ethernet networks for all SVMs in iSCSI configurations.

This documentation demonstrates the process of creating a new SVM and specifying the IP address information to create multiple LIFs for iSCSI traffic. To add new LIFs to an existing SVM refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[Create a LIF (network interface)].

TIP: In situations where multiple VMkernel adapters are configured on the same IP network, it is recommended to use software iSCSI port binding on the ESXi hosts to ensure that load balancing across the adapters occurs. Refer to KB article link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2038869[Considerations for using software iSCSI port binding in ESX/ESXi (2038869)].

For additional information on using VMFS iSCSI datastores with VMware refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/virtualization/vsphere_ontap_auto_block_iscsi.html[vSphere VMFS Datastore - iSCSI Storage backend with ONTAP].

=== Deployment Steps
To deploy ONTAP Tools and use it to create a VMFS datastore on the VCF management domain, complete the following steps:

==== Create SVM and LIFs on ONTAP storage system
The following step is is performed in ONTAP System Manager.

// tag::create-svm[]

.Create the storage VM and LIFs
[%collapsible]
==== 
Complete the following steps to create an SVM together with multiple LIFs for iSCSI traffic.

. From ONTAP System Manager navigate to *Storage VMs* in the left-hand menu and click on *+ Add* to start. 
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image01.png[Click +Add to start creating SVM]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *Add Storage VM* wizard provide a *Name* for the SVM, select the *IP Space* and then, under *Access Protocol, click on the *iSCSI* tab and check the box to *Enable iSCSI*.
+

. In the *Network Interface* section fill in the *IP address*, *Subnet Mask*, and *Broadcast Domain and Port* for the first LIF. For subsequent LIFs the checkbox may be enabled to use common settings across all remaining LIFs or use separate settings.
+
NOTE: For multipathing and failover across multiple paths, NetApp recommends having a minimum of two LIFs per storage node in separate Ethernet networks for all SVMs in iSCSI configurations.
+

==== Set up networking for iSCSI on ESXi hosts
The following steps are performed on the VCF management domain cluster using the vSphere client.

.Create Distributed Port Groups for iSCSI traffic
[%collapsible]
====
Complete the following to create a new distributed port group for each iSCSI network:

. From the vSphere client for the management domain cluster, navigate to *Inventory > Networking*. Navigate to the existing Distributed Switch and choose the action to create *New Distributed Port Group...*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image05.png[Choose to create new port group]
