===== VMware Virtual Volumes (vVols)
vVols are a revolutionary new approach to storage management in vSphere clusters, providing simplified management and more granular control of storage resources. In a vVols datastore each virtual disk is a vVol and becomes a native LUN object on the storage system. The integration of the storage system and vSphere takes place through the VMware API’s for Storage Awareness (VASA) provider and allows the storage system to be aware of the VM data and manage it accordingly. Storage policies, defined in the vCenter Client are used to allocate and manage storage resources. 

vVols are a simplified approach to storage management and are preferred in some use cases.

For more information on vVols see the https://core.vmware.com/resource/vvols-getting-started-guide[vVols Getting Started Guide].

===== NVMe over Fabrics
With the release of vSphere 8.0, NVMe is now supported end-to-end with full support for vVols with NVMe-TCP and NVMe-FC. 

For detailed information on using NVMe with vSphere refer to https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-storage/GUID-2A80F528-5B7D-4BE9-8EF6-52E2301DC423.html[About VMware NVMe Storage] in the vSphere Storage documentation.


=== NetApp ONTAP
NetApp ONTAP software has been a leading storage solution for VMware vSphere environments for almost two decades and continues to add innovative capabilities to simplify management while reducing costs. Using ONTAP together with vSphere is a great combination that lets you reduce host hardware and VMware software expenses. You can also protect your data at lower cost with consistent high performance while taking advantage of native storage efficiencies. 

==== Base ONTAP Features
NetApp Snapshot copies: Snapshot copies of a VM or datastore, ensuring no performance impact upon the creation or utilization of a Snapshot. These replicas can serve as restoration points for VMs or as a simple data safeguard. These array-based snapshots are different than VMware (consistency) snapshots. The most straightforward method to generate an ONTAP Snapshot copy is through the SnapCenter Plug-In for VMware vSphere, backing up VMs and datastores.

* *Storage Efficiency* - ONTAP provides real-time and background deduplication and compression, zero-block deduplication, and data compaction.

* *Volume and LUN move* - Allows non-disruptive movement of volumes and LUNs supporting vSphere datastores and vVols within the ONTAP cluster to balance performance and capacity or support non-disruptive maintenance and upgrades.

* *Relocation of Volume and LUN* - ONTAP allows non-disruptive movement of volumes and LUNs that host vSphere datastores and vVols within the ONTAP cluster. This aids in balancing performance and capacity, and allows for non-disruptive upgrades.

* *Quality of Service* - QoS is a feature that enables the management of performance on an individual LUN, volume, or file. It can be used to limit an aggressive VM or to ensure that a critical VM receives sufficient performance resources.

* *Encryption* - NetApp Volume Encryption and NetApp Aggregate Encryption. These options provide a straightforward software-based approach to encrypting data at rest, ensuring its protection.

* *Fabric Pool* - This feature tiers less frequently accessed data to a separate object store, freeing up valuable flash storage. By operating at the block level, it efficiently identifies and tiers colder data, helping to optimize storage resources and reduce costs.

* *Automation* -  Simplifies storage and data management tasks by utilizing ONTAP REST APIs for automation, and leveraging Ansible modules for seamless configuration management of ONTAP systems. Ansible modules offer a convenient solution for efficiently managing the configurations of ONTAP systems. The combination of these powerful tools enables the streamlining of workflows and enhancement of the overall management of storage infrastructure.


==== ONTAP Disaster Recovery Features

NetApp ONTAP provides robust disaster recovery solutions for VMware environments. These solutions leverage SnapMirror replication technologies between primary and secondary storage systems to allow failover and quick recovery in the case of failure.

*Storage Replication Adapter:*
The NetApp Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) is a software component that provides integration between NetApp storage systems and VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM). It facilitates replication of virtual machine (VM) data across NetApp storage arrays, delivering robust data protection and disaster recovery capabilities. The SRA uses SnapMirror and SnapVault to achieve the replication of VM data across disparate storage systems or geographical locations.

The adapter provides asynchronous replication at the storage virtual machine (SVM) level using SnapMirror technology and extends support for both VMFS in SAN storage environments (iSCSI and FC) and NFS in NAS storage environments.

The NetApp SRA is installed as part of ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere.

For information on the NetApp Storage Replication Adapter for SRM refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-apps-dbs/vmware/vmware-srm-overview.html[VMware Site Recovery Manager with NetApp ONTAP].

*SnapMirror Business Continuity:*
SnapMirror is a NetApp data replication technology that provides synchronous replication of data between storage systems. It allows for the creation of multiple copies of data at different locations, providing the ability to recover data in case of a disaster or data loss event. SnapMirror provides flexibility in terms of replication frequency and allows for the creation of point-in-time copies of data for backup and recovery purposes. SM-BC replicates data at the Consistency Group level.

image::vmware-asa-image4.png[width=800]

For more information refer to SnapMirror https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/smbc/[Business Continuity overview].

*NetApp MetroCluster:* 
NetApp MetroCluster is a high-availability and disaster recovery solution that provides synchronous data replication between two geographically dispersed NetApp storage systems. It is designed to ensure continuous data availability and protection in the event of a site-wide failure.

MetroCluster uses SyncMirror to synchronously replicate data just above the RAID level. SyncMirror is designed to efficiently transition between synchronous and asynchronous modes. This allows the primary storage cluster to continue operating in a non-replicated state in situations where the secondary site becomes temporarily inaccessible. SyncMirror will also replicate back to a RPO = 0 state when connectivity is restored. 

MetroCluster can operate over IP based networks or using fibre channel.

==== Active-active technology
NetApp All-Flash SAN Arrays allows for active-active paths through both controllers, eliminating the need for the host operating system to wait for an active path to fail before activating the alternative path. This means that the host can utilize all available paths on all controllers, ensuring active paths are always present regardless of whether the system is in a steady state or undergoing a controller failover operation.

Furthermore, the NetApp ASA offers a distinctive feature that greatly enhances the speed of SAN failover. Each controller continuously replicates essential LUN metadata to its partner. As a result, each controller is prepared to take over data serving responsibilities in the event of a sudden failure of its partner. This readiness is possible because the controller already possesses the necessary information to start utilizing the drives that were previously managed by the failed controller.

With active-active pathing, both planned and unplanned takeovers have IO resumption times of 2-3 seconds.
