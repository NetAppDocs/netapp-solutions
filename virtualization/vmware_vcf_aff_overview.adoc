== NetApp AFF Arrays with VMware Cloud Foundation
VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is an integrated data center (SDDC) platform that provides a complete stack of software-defined infrastructure for running enterprise applications in a hybrid cloud environment. It combines compute, storage, networking, and management capabilities into a unified platform, offering a consistent operational experience across private and public clouds.

This document provides information on storage options available for VMware Cloud Foundation using the NetApp All-Flash AFF storage system. Supported storage options are covered with specific instruction for creating workload domains with NFS and vVol datastores as principal storage as well as a range of supplemental storage options.


* Storage options for customers seeking uniform environments across both private and public clouds.
* Automated solution for deploying virtual infrastructure for workload domains.
* Scalable storage solution tailored to meet evolving needs, even when not aligned directly with compute resource requirements.


=== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people: 

* Customers looking for more flexible storage options for VMware environments that are designed to maximize TCO.
* Storage administrators wanting to understand how to configure VCF with principal and supplemental storage.
* Customers looking for VCF storage options that provide data protection and disaster recovery options with the major cloud providers.

== VMware Cloud Foundation Overview

VMware Cloud Foundation extends VMwareâ€™s vSphere hypervisor offerings by combining key components such as SDDC Manager, vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and VMware Aria Suite to create a virtualized datacenter.

The VCF solution supports both native Kubernetes and virtual machine-based workloads. Key services such as VMware vSphere, VMware vSAN, VMware NSX-T Data Center, and VMware vRealize Cloud Management are integral components of the VCF package. When combined, these services establish a software-defined infrastructure capable of efficiently managing compute, storage, networking, security, and cloud management.

VCF is comprised of a single management domain and up to 24 VI Workload Domains..... (to be continued)

=== VCF Storage Options
VMware divides storage options for VCF into Principal and Supplemental storage. The VCF Management Domain must use vSAN as its Principal storage. However, there are many supplemental storage options for the Management Domain and both principal and supplemental storage options available for VI Workload Domains.

==== Principal Storage
Principal Storage refers to any type of storage that can be directly connected to a VI Workload Domain during the setup process within SDDC Manager. Principal storage is the first datastore configured for a Workload Domain and includes vSAN, vVols (VMFS), NFS and VMFS on Fibre Channel.


==== Supplemental Storage
Supplemental storage is the storage type that can be added to the management or workload domains at any time after the cluster has been created. Supplemental storage represents the widest range of supported storage options, all of which are supported on NetApp AFF arrays.
