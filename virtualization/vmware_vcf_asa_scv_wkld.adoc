== Use SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere to protect VMs on VCF Workload Domains

=== Scenario Overview
In this scenario we will demonstrate how to deploy and use the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere (SCV) to backup and restore VM's and datastores on a VCF Workload Domain. 

*iSCSI* is used as the storage protocol for the VMFS datastore.

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere (SCV) on the VI Workload Domain.
* Add storage systems to SCV.
* Create backup policies in SCV.
* Create Resource Groups in SCV.
* Use SCV to backup datastores or specific VMs.
* Use SCV to restores VMs to an alternate location in the cluster.
* Use SCV to restores files to a windows file system.

=== Prerequisites
This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* An ONTAP ASA storage system with iSCSI VMFS datastores allocated to the Workload Domain cluster.
* A secondary ONTAP storage system configured to received secondary backups using SnapMirror.
* VCF Management Domain deployment is complete and the vSphere client is accessible.
* A VI Workload Domain has been previously deployed.

For information on configuring iSCSI VMFS datastores as supplemental storage refer to Link:https://linkgoeshere.com[*iSCSI as supplemental storage for Management Domains*] in this documentation. The process for using OTV to deploy datastores is identical for Management and Workload Domains.


TIP: In addition to replicating backups taken with SCV to secondary storage, offsite copies of data can be made to object storage on one of the three (3) leading cloud providers using NetApp BlueXP backup and recovery for VMs. For more information refer to the solution link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/ehc/bxp-scv-hybrid-solution.html[3-2-1 Data Protection for VMware with SnapCenter Plug-in and BlueXP backup and recovery for VMs].





=== Deployment Steps
To deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in and use it to create backup and restore VMs and datastores, complete the following steps:

==== Deploy and use SCV to protect and restore data in VI Workload Domain
Complete the following steps to deploy, configure, and use SCV to protect data and restore data to a VI Workload Domain:

.Deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere
[%collapsible]
==== 
The SnapCenter Plug-in is installed on the VCF Management Domain but registered to the vCenter for the VI Workload Domain.

Complete the following steps from the vCenter client to deploy SCV to the VI Workload Domain:

. Download the OVA file for the SCV deployment from the download area of the NetApp support site link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/scv/downloads-tab[*HERE*].

. From the Management Domain vCenter Client, select to *Deploy OVF Template...*.

+
{nbsp}
. In the *Deploy OVF Template* wizard, click on the *Local file* radio button and then select to upload the previously downloaded OVF template. Click on *Next* to continue.
+

+
{nbsp}
. On the *Select name and folder* page, provide a name for the SCV data broker VM and a folder on the Management Domain. Click on *Next* to continue.

. On the *Select a compute resource* page, select the Management Domain cluster or specific ESXi host within the cluster to install the VM to.

. Review information pertaining to the OVF template on the *Review details* page and agree to the licensing terms on the *Licensing agreements* page. 

. On the *Select storage* page choose the datastore which the VM will be installed to and select the *virtual disk format* and *VM Storage Policy*. In this solution, the VM will be installed on an iSCSI VMFS datastore located on an ONTAP storage system, as previously deployed in a separate section of this documentation. Click on *Next* to continue.

. On the *Select network* page, select the management network that is able to communicate with the Workload Domain vCenter appliance and both the primary and secondary ONTAP storage systems.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image49.png[select management network]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Customize template* page fill out all information required for the deployment:

* FQDN or IP, and credentials for the Workload Domain vCenter appliance.
* Credentials for the SCV administrative account.
* Credentials for the SCV maintenance account.
* IPv4 Network Properties details (IPv6 can also be used).
* Date and Time settings.
+
Click on *Next* to continue.
