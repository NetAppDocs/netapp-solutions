This document provides an overview of why NetApp is the best platform for virtualization enviroments - regardless of the virtualization solution.

== Introduction

Given VMware's recent licensing changes, organizations must adapt their virtualization strategies to maintain cost efficiency and scalability. Optimizing existing VMware environments, considering migration from standalone vSphere to VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) using existing enterprise storage and embracing a multi-hypervisor or hybrid cloud approach are pivotal steps. Notably, VCF 5.2.1 introduced enhanced flexibility by allowing the use of alternative storage solutions beyond vSAN, which makes it easy for organizations to adopt the new licensing mechanism while using enterprise storage functionalities and continue to run in a seamless fashion.

ONTAP is the right platform for any hypervisor in on-premises or for any workload in the cloud. ONTAP supports all the prominent hypervisors in on-premises and have first party offering in each cloud supporting VMware cloud offerings and cloud native workloads. This enables organizations to handle the licensing change easily by navigating through the appropriate deployment model.
This paper outlines strategies for optimizing VMware deployments, evaluates multi-hypervisor adoption, details the migration of VMs from vSphere to VCF and migration of VMs to alternate hypervisors covering all available options.

== What Changed

Broadcom's acquisition of VMware has led to a significant shift in VMware's licensing model. The new approach is transitioning to a subscription-based pricing structure, which, while in line with industry trends, is expected to result in substantially higher costs. Here are two major points to keep in mind:

*Subscription-Based Licensing*: VMware is moving away from perpetual licenses to subscription-based models.

*Per socket to core*: The shift from per CPU to per core socket pricing indicates a significant change that could substantially increase costs.

=== Key takeaway 

It is prompting customers to evaluate their resource needs, optimize utilization more effectively and explore alternative options as a result of this change.

== Why ONTAP

NetApp storage solutions are at the forefront of providing solutions that empower and enable customers to take full advantage of all the benefits of a virtualized infrastructure. With NetApp solutions, customers can rapidly deploy comprehensive data management software delivering automation, efficiency, data protection and security capabilities while meeting any demanding performance needs. Combining ONTAP software with VMware vSphere allows to reduce host hardware and VMware licensing expenses, make sure data is protected at lower cost, and provide consistent high performance. Virtualized workloads are mobile. 

Therefore, administrators use VMware Storage vMotion to move VMs across VMware Virtual Machine File System (VMFS), NFS, or vVols datastores, all residing on the same storage system and thus explore different storage approaches if using an All-Flash System or use the latest ASA models with SAN innovation for higher cost efficiency. 

image:virt-options-image1.png["Diagram of the benefits on NetApp ONTAP"]

The ONTAP storage solution offers the following benefits:

* *Independent scaling*: Grow Storage Without Adding Compute. Offload workload data management, protection, and mobility to storage integrated with vSphere.

* *Blazing Fast Performance*: Provide sub-millisecond latency and high throughput with cutting-edge NVMe and ASA architectures. Optimize flash, NVMe, and GPU performance for traditional VMs and modern Kubernetes or AI deployments.

* *Comprehensive Data Services*: Compress, dedupe, and compact data using built in capabilities for 5-30X less storage with 85-90% more data center efficiency.

* *Seamless Clustering and High Availability*: Utilize SnapMirror active sync and MetroCluster for effortless stretch clustering and robust disaster recovery.

* *Multi-Protocol*: ONTAP supports access to data through multiple protocols, i.e., NFS, iSCSI, SMB and S3. Systems running ONTAP are unified in several significant ways. Originally this approach referred to both NAS and SAN protocols, and ONTAP continues to be a leading platform for SAN along with its original strength in NAS. 

* *Automated provisioning and orchestration*: Leverage ONTAP tools for VMware and its REST APIs, vSphere plugins, and SPBM (Storage Policies) to automate and streamline storage management.

* *Integrated Data protection and low-cost disaster recovery*: Offload virtual workload backup and restore using NetApp SnapCenter and deliver zero RPO and lower RTO data replication. There’s no need to acquire and deploy expensive alternative infrastructure providing low-cost disaster protection for VMware workloads, from on-premises to on-premises NetApp ONTAP environments or to VMware Cloud along with NetApp powered cloud storage.

* *Ransomware Detection*: Extend VMware-level security and compliance to data to improve protection, detection, remediation, and recovery capabilities via built-in autonomous ransomware protection and zero trust compatibility by enabling multifactor authentication, role-based access, comprehensive logging, and user behaviour anomaly detection.

* *Integrated Hybrid Cloud*: Simplified and integrated for workload mobility, backup and restore, and disaster recovery into to any hyperscalar cloud (VMC, EVS, AVS, and GCVE).

* *Storage Lifecycle Program (SLP)*: Non-disruptively upgrade to the next generation controller or opt for cloud storage if organization is ready to take that step.

=== Key takeway

* With ONTAP, start with the initial capacity and leverage its tiering functionality to offload data to object storage. This approach reduces overall costs significantly without the need to add new hosts. By optimizing storage usage, you can achieve substantial savings, typically ranging from 20-50%.

* ONTAP storage can be used with multiple workload domains and not constrained to a specific cluster, thus improving the overall utilization.

* Use ONTAP to eliminate CPU impact on ESXi hosts by offloading CPU-intensive tasks such as storage efficiency, encryption, snapshots, and more. This optimization reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) by requiring fewer cores on each host.

* Experience seamless storage with no RAID or storage pools to configure, ongoing data reduction, and encryption.

== Rightsize and optimize

As licensing changes loom, every organisation is under the stress of potentially increased Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). A well-optimized VMware environment maximizes performance while controlling licensing expenses. This ensures effective resource management and capacity planning. With right set of tools, quickly identify wasted or idle resources to reclaim the cores, thus reducing the core count which inturn reduces the overall licensing cost. NetApp offers a powerful suite of tools to overcome these challenges, providing enhanced visibility, seamless integration, cost efficiency, and robust security. By using these capabilities, organizations can survive and even thrive during this disruption and be prepared for whatever other unforeseen challenges the future brings.

*Note*: Keep in mind, most organisations are already doing this as part of their cloud assessment, and it is the same processes and tools that helps in avoiding the cost panic in the on-premises world and save any immediate emotion enabled migration cost to alternate hypervisor.

=== How NetApp Helps

*NetApp TCO Estimator* - NetApp's Free TCO estimation tool

During the workshop, all details are provided to the customer for both on-premises optimization and cloud migration strategies to promote effective utilization of resources and cost mitigation. By implementing these strategies, organizations maintain a high-performance VMware environment while effectively managing costs.

=== Key takeway

VMDC serves as a quick first assessment step before implementing DII for ongoing monitoring nd advanced ML-driven analytics across heterogeneous environments.

== VCF Import Tool - Run VCF with NFS or FC as principal Storage

With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 5.2 comes the capability to convert existing vSphere infrastructure to VCF management domains and import additional clusters as VCF VI workload domains. Along with this VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) can now fully be run on NetApp storage platforms without the requirement to use vSAN (yes, all of this without vSAN). Converting a cluster, with an existing NFS or FC datastore running on ONTAP, involves integrating existing infrastructure into a modern private cloud, which means there is no need for vSAN. 

This process benefits from the flexibility of NFS and FC storage, to ensure seamless data access and management. After a VCF management domain is established through the conversion process, administrators can efficiently import additional vSphere clusters, including those using NFS or FC datastores, into the VCF ecosystem. This integration not only enhances resource utilization but also simplifies the management of private cloud infrastructure, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal disruption to existing workloads.

NOTE: Only supports NFS version 3 and FC protocol when used as principal storage. Supplemental storage can use either vSphere supported NFS protocol version 3 or 4.1

=== Key takeaway

Importing or converting existing ESXi clusters enables to leverage existing ONTAP storage as the datastore and there is no need for deploying vSAN or additional hardware resources, thus making VCF resource-efficient, cost optimized and simplified.

== Migration from Existing vSphere to VCF using ONTAP storage

If VMware Cloud Foundation is a greenfield installation (create a new vSphere infrastructure and Single Sign-On domain), Existing workloads running on older vSphere versions cannot be managed from Cloud Foundation. 

The first step is to migrate current application VMs running on existing vSphere environments into Cloud Foundation. The migration path depends on the migration choices—live, warm, and cold—and by the version of any existing vSphere environments. The following are the options in the order of priority depending on the source storage.

* HCX is the most feature-rich tool currently available for Cloud Foundation workload mobility. 
* Leverage NetApp BlueXP DRaaS
* vSphere replication with SRM can be used easy-to-use vSphere migration tool.
* Use 3rd party software using VAIO and VADP

== Migration VMs from non-NetApp storage to ONTAP storage

The easiest method in most cases is to use Storage vMotion. The cluster should have access to both the new ONTAP SAN or NAS datastore and the storage you are migrating the VMs from (SAN, NAS, etc.). The process is simple: 

* Select one or more VMs in the vSphere Web Client, 
* Right-click the selection, and 
* Click Migrate. 
* Choose the storage-only option, 
* Select the new ONTAP datastore as the destination, and 
* Proceed with the last few steps of the migration wizard. 

vSphere will copy the files – VMX, NVRAM, VMDK(s), etc. – from the old storage to the ONTAP powered datastore. Note that vSphere will potentially be copying large amounts of data. This method does not require any downtime. The VMs continue to run as they are being migrated.

Other options include host-based migration, 3rd party replication to perform the migration.

== Disaster Recovery using Storage Snapshots (optimize further with storage replication)

NetApp offers an industry-leading, SaaS-based disaster recovery (DRaaS) solution that can significantly lower the costs and reduce complexity. There’s no need to acquire and deploy expensive alternative infrastructure. 

Implementing disaster recovery through block-level replication from the production site to the disaster recovery site is a resilient and cost-effective method for safeguarding workloads against site outages and data corruption events, such as ransomware attacks. Using NetApp SnapMirror replication, VMware workloads running on on-premises ONTAP systems with NFS or VMFS datastores can be replicated to another ONTAP storage system located in a designated recovery datacenter where VMware is also deployed. 

Use the BlueXP disaster recovery service, which is integrated into the NetApp BlueXP console wherein customers can discover their on-premises VMware vCenters along with ONTAP storage, create resource groupings, create a disaster recovery plan, associate it with resource groups, and test or execute failover and failback. SnapMirror provides storage-level block replication to keep the two sites up to date with incremental changes, resulting in a RPO of up to 5 minutes. 

It is also possible to simulate DR procedures as a regular drill without impacting the production and replicated datastores or incurring additional storage costs. BlueXP disaster recovery takes advantage of ONTAP’s FlexClone technology to create a space-efficient copy of the VMFS datastore from the last replicated Snapshot on the DR site.  Once the DR test is complete, customers can simply delete the test environment, again without any impact to actual replicated production resources. 

When there is a need (planned or unplanned) for actual failover, with a few clicks, the BlueXP disaster recovery service will orchestrate all the steps needed to automatically bring up the protected virtual machines on designated disaster recovery site. The service will also reverse the SnapMirror relationship to the primary site and replicate any changes from secondary to primary for a failback operation, when needed. All of these can be achieved with a fraction of cost compared to other well-known alternatives. 

NOTE: 3rd party backup products that support replication functionality and SRM with SRA are other prominent alternate options. 

== Ransomware

Detecting ransomware as early as possible is crucial in preventing its spread and avoiding costly downtime. An effective ransomware detection strategy must incorporate multiple layers of protection at ESXi host and guest VM levels. While multiple security measures are implemented to create a comprehensive defense against ransomware attacks, ONTAP enables adding more layers of protection to the overall defense approach.  To name a few capabilities, it starts with Snapshots, Autonomous Ransomware Protection, tamperproof snapshots and so on. 

Let’s look at how the above-mentioned capabilities work with VMware to protect and recover the data against ransomware. To protect vSphere and guest VMs against attacks, it is essential to take several measures including segmenting, utilizing EDR/XDR/SIEM for endpoints and installing security updates and adhering to the appropriate hardening guidelines. Each virtual machine residing on a datastore also hosts a standard operating system. Ensure enterprise server anti-malware product suites are installed and regularly updated on them which is an essential component of multi-layered ransomware protection strategy. Along with this, enable Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) on the NFS volume powering the datastore. ARP leverages built-in onbox ML that looks at volume workload activity plus data entropy to automatically detect ransomware. ARP is configurable through the ONTAP built-in management interface or system Manager and is enabled on a per-volume basis. 

As part of adding multiple layered approach, there is also a native built-in ONTAP solution for protecting unauthorized deletion of backup Snapshot copies. It is known as multiadmin verification or MAV which is available in ONTAP 9.11.1 and later. The ideal approach will be to use queries for MAV specific operations.

NOTE: With the new NetApp ARP/AI, there is no need for a learning mode. Instead, it can go straight to active mode with its AI-powered ransomware detection capability.

NOTE: With ONTAP One, all these feature sets are completely free. Access NetApp's robust suite of data protection, security and all the features that ONTAP offers without worrying about licensing barriers.

== VMware Alternatives to consider

Every organization is evaluating a multi-hypervisor approach, which supports a dual or triple-vendor hypervisor strategy, thus strengthening their operational flexibility, mitigating vendor dependency, and optimizing the workload placement. Organizations then streamline multi-hypervisor management by leveraging interoperability, cost-effective licensing, and automation. ONTAP is the ideal platform for any hypervisor platform. Another key requirement in this approach is dynamic virtual machine mobility based on the SLAs and workload placement strategy. 
 
=== Key Considerations for Multi-Hypervisor Adoption

* *Strategic Cost Optimization*: Reducing reliance on a single vendor optimizes operational and licensing expenses.
* *Workload Distribution*: Deploying the right hypervisor for the right workload maximizes efficiency.
* *Flexibility*: Supports optimization of VMs based on business application requirements along with data center modernization and consolidation.

In this section, let’s cover a quick summary of different hypervisors considered by organizations in their order of priority.

NOTE: These are the common alternative options considered by organizations, however the priority order differs for each customer based on their assessment, skillset and workload requirements.

| Windows-heavy environments | Microsoft Hyper-V
| Linux-heavy environments & cloud-native workloads | KVM
| SMBs, homelabs, hybrid environments |Proxmox VE
| Kubernetes-based VM workloads	| OpenShift Virtualization
|===

Other hypervisor options that are considered which is also in play in customer environments are as follows:

*KVM* is generally supported on ONTAP per the parent Linux distro, simply refer to the IMT for the reference Linux. 

*SUSE Harvester* is a modern hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solution built for bare metal servers using enterprise-grade open-source technologies including Linux, KVM, Kubernetes, KubeVirt, and Longhorn. Designed for users looking for a flexible and affordable solution to run cloud-native and virtual machine (VM) workloads in your datacenter and at the edge, Harvester provides a single pane of glass for virtualization and cloud-native workload management.

Meaning, there is nothing to install! Storage management functions support NVMe, iSCSI or FC for block protocols, and NFS for NAS. Thin provisioning, dynamic storage management, copy offload, and snapshots are all supported natively. 

=== Key takeaway

ONTAP is the right platform for any hypervisor in on-premises or for any workload in the cloud. ONTAP supports prominent hypervisors in on-premises and have widely adopted first party offering in each cloud. This enables to handle the licensing changes easily by navigating through the appropriate deployment model.

== Wicked Fast Migrations

=== Shift Toolkit

As covered above, solutions like VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, Proxmox, and OpenShift Virtual Environment have become robust and reliable choices for virtualization needs. Given that business requirements are dynamic, the selection of a virtualization platform must also be adaptable and instant virtual machine mobility becomes important.

Migrating from one hypervisor to another involves a complex decision-making process for businesses. Key considerations include application dependencies, migration timeline, workload criticality, and the impact of application downtime on the business. However, with ONTAP storage and Shift toolkit, this is a breeze.

The NetApp Shift toolkit is an easy-to-use, graphical user interface (GUI) solution that allows to migrate virtual machines (VMs) between different hypervisors and convert virtual disk formats. It utilizes NetApp FlexClone® technology to quickly convert VM hard disks. Additionally, the toolkit manages the creation and configuration of destination VMs. For detailed information, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/vm-migrate/migrate-overview.html#usecase[Migrating virtual machines (VMs) between virtualization environments (Shift Toolkit)].

image:virt-options-image3.png["Diagram of the capabilities of the Shift Toolkit"]

Note: The pre-requisite for Shift toolkit is to have VMs running on NFS volume residing on ONTAP storage. This means if the VMs are hosted on block based ONTAP storage (specifically ASA) or on third party storage, then VMs should be moved using storage vmotion to the designated ONTAP based NFS datastores.

Shift toolkit can be downloaded here and is available for Windows Systems only.

=== Cirrus Data MigrateOps

An alternate to Shift toolkit is partner based solution which relies on block level replication. Cirrus Data can seamlessly migrate workloads from traditional hypervisors to modern platforms, enabling more flexible hybrid workloads, accelerated modernization efforts, and improved resource utilization. Cirrus Migrate Cloud, together with MigrateOps™, make it possible for organizations to automate the change from one hypervisor to another with a secure, easy-to-use, and reliable solution.


=== Key takeaway

There are multiple alternatives for migrating a VM from VMware to another hypervisor. To name a few – Veeam, Commvault, Starwind, SCVMM and so on. The objective here is to showcase the best validated options, however, Shift toolkit would provide the fastest migration option. Depending on the scenario, alternate migrate options can be adopted.

== Sample Deployment model:

Customer has 10000 VMs with a mix of windows and linux workloads. To optimize the licensing cost and simplify the future of virtualization infrastructure, multi hypervisor and vm placement strategy was important. They chose the VM strategy based on the workload criticality, performance requirement, hypervisor functionality and licensing cost.

The Tier 0 VMs were retained on VMware (1000 VMs) followed by Tier 1/Tier 2 moving to Hyper-V (5000 VMs). The rest 4000 VMs was moved to OpenShift virtualization (primarily Linux based VMs). This hybrid VM placement helped them in controlling the cost while retaining the control, process, tools and functionality.

The above is one example, however there are different permutations and combinations that can be applied at each application level to optimize the environment.

== Conclusion 

In the wake of the Broadcom acquisition, VMware customers are navigating a complex landscape of integration, performance optimization, and cost management. NetApp offers powerful suite of tools and capabilities to overcome these challenges, providing enhanced visibility, seamless integration, cost efficiency, and robust security. By using these capabilities, stay with VMware and optimise to survive and even thrive during the Broadcom disruption and be prepared for whatever other unforeseen challenges the future brings.

If moving to an alternative hypervisor platform is the desired choice, there are several robust alternatives to VMware that organization can consider for virtualization needs. Hyper-V, Proxmox, and KVM each offer unique advantages. To determine the best fit, evaluate factors such as budget, existing infrastructure, performance requirements, and support needs. No matter what hypervisor platform is selected, ONTAP is the ideal storage.
