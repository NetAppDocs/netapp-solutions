[.lead]
VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is an integrated software-defined data center (SDDC) platform that provides a complete stack of software-defined infrastructure for running enterprise applications in a hybrid cloud environment. It combines compute, storage, networking, and management capabilities into a unified platform, offering a consistent operational experience across private and public clouds.

This documentation provides information on storage options available for VMware Cloud Foundation using the NetApp All-Flash SAN Array (ASA). Supported storage options are covered in depth and NetApp ONTAP Tools is used to manage storage on VCF VI Workload Domains.

* Storage options for customers seeking uniform environments across both private and public clouds.
* Automated solution for deploying virtual infrastructure for workload domains.
* Explore a scalable storage solution tailored to meet evolving needs, even when not necessarily aligned with compute resource requirements.


== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people: 

* Customers looking for more flexible storage options for VMware environments that are designed to maximize TCO.
* Customers looking for VCF storage options that provide data protection and disaster recovery options with the major cloud providers.
* 

== VMware Cloud Foundation Overview

VMware Cloud Foundation extends VMwareâ€™s vSphere hypervisor offerings by combining key components such as SDDC Manager, vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and VMware Aria Suite to create a virtualized datacenter

Within the VCF solution, support is available for both native Kubernetes and virtual machine-based workloads. Key services such as VMware vSphere, VMware vSAN, VMware NSX-T Data Center, and VMware vRealize Cloud Management are integral components of the VCF package. When combined, these services establish a software-defined infrastructure capable of efficiently managing compute, storage, networking, security, and cloud management.

==== Principal Storage
Principal storage is the storage type selected when first creating a new VI workload domain.


==== Supplemental Storage
Supplemental storage is the storage type that can be added to the management or workload domains at any time after the cluster has been created. This is the widest level of support available for vSphere clusters and ....
