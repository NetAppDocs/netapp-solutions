== Solution Overview

=== Introduction
For nearly two decades, NetApp ONTAP software has established itself as a premier storage solution for VMware vSphere environments, continually introducing innovative features that simplify management and decrease costs. NetApp is an established leader in the development of NAS and unified storage platforms that offer a wide range of protocol and connectivity support. Alongside this market segment, there are many customers who prefer the simplicity and cost benefits of block-based SAN storage platforms that are focused on doing one job well. NetAppâ€™s All-Flash SAN Array (AFF ASA) delivers on that promise with simplicity at scale and with consistent management and automation features for all applications and cloud providers. 

=== Purpose of this Document
In this document we will cover the unique value of using NetApp AFF ASA storage systems with VMware vSphere and provide a technology overview of the NetApp All-Flash SAN Array. In addition, we will look at additional tools for simplifying storage provisioning, data protection, and monitoring of your VMware and ONTAP datacenter.
