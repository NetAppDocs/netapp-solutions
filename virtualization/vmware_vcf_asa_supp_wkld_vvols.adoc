== Use ONTAP Tools to configure supplemental storage for VCF Workload Domains

=== Scenario Overview
In this scenario we will demonstrate how to deploy and use ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere (OTV) to configure a *vVols datastore* for a VCF Workload Domain. 

*iSCSI* will be used as the storage protocol for the vVols datastore.

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Create a storage virtual machine (SVM) with logical interfaces (LIFs) for iSCSI traffic.
* Create distributed port groups for iSCSI networks on the VI Workload Domain.
* Create vmkernel adapters for iSCSI on the ESXi hosts for the VI Workload Domain.
* Deploy ONTAP Tools on the VI Workload Domain.
* Create a new vVols datastore on the VI Workload Domain.

=== Prerequisites
This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* An ONTAP ASA storage system with physical data ports on ethernet switches dedicated to storage traffic.
* VCF Management Domain deployment is complete and the vSphere client is accessible.
* A VI Workload Domain has been previously deployed.

For multipathing and failover across multiple paths, NetApp recommends having a minimum of two LIFs per storage node in separate ethernet networks for all SVMs in iSCSI configurations.

This documentation demonstrates the process of creating a new SVM and specifying the IP address information to create multiple LIFs for iSCSI traffic. To add new LIFs to an existing SVM refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.htm[Create a LIF (network interface)].

TIP: In situations where multiple VMkernel adapters are configured on the same IP network, it is recommended to use software iSCSI port binding on the ESXi hosts to ensure that load balancing across the adapters occurs. Refer to KB article link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2038869[Considerations for using software iSCSI port binding in ESX/ESXi (2038869)].

For additional information on using VMFS iSCSI datastores with VMware refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/virtualization/vsphere_ontap_auto_block_iscsi.html[vSphere VMFS Datastore - iSCSI Storage backend with ONTAP].

=== Deployment Steps
To deploy ONTAP Tools and use it to create a vVols datastore on the VCF Management Domain, complete the following steps:

==== Create SVM and LIFs on ONTAP storage system
The following step is performed in ONTAP System Manager.

.Create the storage VM and LIFs
[%collapsible]
==== 
Complete the following steps to create an SVM together with multiple LIFs for iSCSI traffic.

. From ONTAP System Manager navigate to *Storage VMs* in the left-hand menu and click on *+ Add* to start. 
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image01.png[Click +Add to start creating SVM]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *Add Storage VM* wizard provide a *Name* for the SVM, select the *IP Space* and then, under *Access Protocol*, click on the *iSCSI* tab and check the box to *Enable iSCSI*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image02.png[Add storage VM wizard - enable iSCSI]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *Network Interface* section fill in the *IP address*, *Subnet Mask*, and *Broadcast Domain and Port* for the first LIF. For subsequent LIFs the checkbox may be enabled to use common settings across all remaining LIFs or use separate settings.
+
NOTE: For multipathing and failover across multiple paths, NetApp recommends having a minimum of two LIFs per storage node in separate Ethernet networks for all SVMs in iSCSI configurations.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image03.png[Fill out network info for LIFs]

==== Set up networking for iSCSI on ESXi hosts
The following steps are performed on the VI Workload Domain cluster using the vSphere client. In this case vCenter Single Sign-On is being used so the vSphere client is common across the management and workload domains.

.Create Distributed Port Groups for iSCSI traffic
[%collapsible]
====
Complete the following to create a new distributed port group for each iSCSI network:

. From the vSphere client , navigate to *Inventory > Networking* for the Workload Domain. Navigate to the existing Distributed Switch and choose the action to create *New Distributed Port Group...*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image22.png[Choose to create new port group]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *New Distributed Port Group* wizard fill in a name for the new port group and click on *Next* to continue.

. On the *Configure settings* page fill out all settings. In this case VLAN is select for VLAN ID and the VLAN value provided. Click on *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image23.png[Fill out VLAN ID]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Ready to complete* page, review the changes and click on *Finish* to create the new distributed port group.

. Repeat this process to create a distributed port group for the second iSCSI network being used and ensure you have input the correct *VLAN ID*.

. Once both port groups have been created, navigate to the first port group and select the action to *Edit settings...*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image24.png[DPG - edit settings]
+
{nbsp}
. On *Distributed Port Group - Edit Settings* page, navigate to *Teaming and failover* in the left-hand menu and click on *uplink2* to move it down to *Unused uplinks*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image25.png[move uplink2 to unused]

. Repeat this step for the second iSCSI port group. However, this time move *uplink1* down to *Unused uplinks*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image26.png[move uplink1 to unused]
====

.Create VMkernel adapters on each ESXi host
[%collapsible]
====
Repeat this process on each ESXi host in the Workload Domain.

. From the vSphere client navigate to one of the ESXi hosts in the Workload Domain inventory. From the *Configure* tab select *VMkernel adapters* and click on *Add Networking...* to start.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image30.png[Start add networking wizard]

+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image31.png[Choose target port group]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Port properties* page keep the defaults and click on *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image32.png[VMkernel port properties]

==== Deploy and use ONTAP Tools to configure storage
The following steps are performed on the VCF Management Domain cluster using the vSphere client and involve deploying OTV, creating a vVols iSCSI datastore, and migrating management VM's to the new datastore.

For VI Workload Domains, OTV is installed to the VCF Management Cluster but registered with the vCenter associated with the VI Workload Domain. 

For additional information on deploying and using ONTAP Tools in a multiple vCenter environment refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere/configure/concept_requirements_for_registering_vsc_in_multiple_vcenter_servers_environment.html[Requirements for registering ONTAP tools in multiple vCenter Servers environment].
