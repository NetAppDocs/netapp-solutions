== VMware Aria[[aria]]

*What is VMware Aria?*

VMware Aria is an intelligent multi-cloud management solution that enables you to consistently deploy and operate your apps, infrastructure, and platform services across private, hybrid, and multiple clouds from a single platform with a common data model.

== VMware Virtual Volumes (vvols) [[vvols]]

*What is VMware virtual volumes (vVols)?*

vVols use storage policy-based management (SPBM) to eliminate storage provisioning and use descriptive policies at the VM or VMDK level that can be applied or changed in minutes. SPBM accelerates storage operations and reduces the need for specialized skills for storage infrastructure.

== VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) [[vcf]]

*What is VMware Cloud Foundation?*

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is a hybrid cloud platform for both traditional enterprise and modern applications. Built on VMware’s software-defined stack for compute, storage, network, container, and cloud management.  

link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere/deploy/vmware_cloud_foundation_mode_deployment.html[See how] NetApp infrastructure works with VCF. 

== #VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM)# [[srm]]

== VMware Cloud Services [[vmc]]

*What is hybrid multicloud with VMware & NetApp?*

No other infrastructure provider can support workloads on VMware both on-premises and in the cloud, any cloud.  NetApp is the first infrastructure provider to support VMware in the cloud on AWS, MS Azure and Google Cloud. 

Each of the major public cloud providers offer virtualization services on which applications and workloads can be run as they are on-premises.

NetApp provides a full set of solutions for these cloud virtualization environments.
