[.lead]
The NetApp and VMware partnership is the only partnership where a single storage system addresses all of the key VMware defined use cases.

== VMware vSphere [[vsphere]]

*What is VMware vSphere?*

vSphere is the product name for VMware's suite of server virtualization products that includes its ESXi hypervisor and vCenter management software.

*What is FlexPod?*

FlexPod is a converged infrastructure solution offered by the Cisco / NetApp partnership.  It contains an "all in one" virtual datacenter composed of compute, network and storage.  FlexPod offers many solutions based on VMware products.

*Why is NVMe over TCP important to VMs?*

For VM’s running on NVMe over TCP, you can reduce CPU utilization and gain performance and reliability with NVMe coupled with Virtual Volumes on NetApp for scalability, simplicity, and automation.

*How do VMware datastores work?*

Datastores are logical containers, analogous to file systems, that hide specifics of physical storage and provide a uniform model for storing virtual machine files. Datastores can also be used for storing ISO images, virtual machine templates, and floppy images.

*Why does VMware care about external storage?*

== VMware HCX[[hcx]]

*What is VMware HCX?*

VMware HCX is an application mobility platform designed for simplifying application migration, rebalancing workloads, and optimizing disaster recovery across data centers and clouds.

HCX provides services between two or more distinct environments. The environments might be running legacy vSphere, or they might be running modern vSphere SDDC, they might also be VMware-based public cloud instances.

== VMware Tanzu[[tanzu]]

*What is VMware Tanzu?*

vSphere with Tanzu is the new generation of vSphere for containerized applications. This single, streamlined solution bridges the gap between IT operations and developers with a new kind of infrastructure for modern, cloud-native applications both on premises and in public clouds.

== VMware Aria[[aria]]

*What is VMware Aria?*

VMware Aria is an intelligent multi-cloud management solution that enables you to consistently deploy and operate your apps, infrastructure, and platform services across private, hybrid, and multiple clouds from a single platform with a common data model.

== VMware Virtual Volumes (vVols) [[vvols]]

*What is VMware virtual volumes (vVols)?*

VMware vVols is the low-level storage for virtual machines that supports operations on the storage array level, similarly to traditional LUNs used to create datastores. Instead of using the traditional VMFS file system, a storage array defines how to provide access and organize data for VMs using the storage array.

== VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) [[vcf]]

*What is VMware Cloud Foundation?*

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is a hybrid cloud platform for both traditional enterprise and modern applications. Built on VMware’s software-defined stack for compute, storage, network, container, and cloud management.  

*What is principal and supplemental storage and why is NetApp relevant?*

== VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) [[srm]]

*What is VMware Site Recovery Manager?*

Site Recovery Manager (SRM) is the industry-leading disaster recovery (DR) management solution, designed to minimize downtime in case of a disaster. It provides policy-based management, automated orchestration, and non-disruptive testing of centralized recovery plans.

== VMware Cloud Services [[vmc]]

*What is hybrid multicloud with VMware & NetApp?*

No other infrastructure provider can support workloads on VMware both on-premises and in the cloud, any cloud.  NetApp is the first infrastructure provider to support VMware in the cloud on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. 

Each of the major public cloud providers offer virtualization services on which applications and workloads can be run as they are on-premises.

NetApp provides a full set of solutions for these cloud virtualization environments.
