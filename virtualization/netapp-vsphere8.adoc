The NetApp and VMware partnership is the only partnership where a single storage system addresses all of the key VMware defined use cases.

== Modern & Cloud-Connected All-Flash For vSphere 8

ONTAP implementations run on a variety of platforms including NetApp-engineered appliances, commodity hardware and in the public cloud. ONTAP offers unified storage whether you access over SAN or NAS protocols and in configurations ranging from high-speed flash to lower-cost media to cloud-based storage. NetApp also offers purpose-built flash platforms to simplify and segment your storage needs without creating silos. Furthermore, NetApp offers software to easily allow data movement across on-premises and cloud. Finally, NetApp BlueXP provides a single dashboard for managing all these relationships and your storage footprint.
