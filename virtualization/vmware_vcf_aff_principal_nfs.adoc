== NFS as principal storage for VI Workload Domains

=== Scenario Overview
In this scenario we will demonstrate how to configure an NFS datastore as principal storage for the deployment of a VI Workload Domain in VCF. Where appropriate we will refer to external documentation for the steps that must be performed in VCF's SDDC Manager, and cover those steps that are specific to the storage configuration portion.

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Verify networking for the ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM) and that a logical interface (LIF) is present to carry NFS traffic.
* Create an export policy to allow the ESXi hosts access to the NFS volume.
* Create an NFS volume on the ONTAP storage system.
* Create a Network Pool for NFS and vMotion traffic in SDDC Manager.
* Commission hosts in VCF for use in a VI Workload Domain.
* Deploy a VI Workload Domain in VCF using an NFS datastore as principal storage.
* Install NetApp NFS Plug-in for VMware VAAI

=== Prerequisites
This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* NetApp AFF storage system with a storage virtual machine (SVM) configured to allow NFS traffic.
* Logical interface (LIF) has been created on the IP network that is to carry NFS traffic and is associated with the SVM.
* VCF management domain deployment is complete and the SDDC Manager interface is accessible.
* 4 x ESXi hosts configured for communication on the VCF management network.
* IP addresses reserved for vMotion and NFS storage traffic on the VLAN or network segment established for this purpose.

[NOTE]
When deploying a VI Workload Domain, VCF validates connectivity to the NFS Server. This is done using the management adapter on the ESXi hosts before any additional vmkernel adapter is added with the NFS IP address. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that either 1) the management network is routable to the NFS Server, or 2) a LIF for the management network has been added to the SVM hosting the NFS datastore volume, to ensure that the validation can proceed.

For information on configuring ONTAP storage systems refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap[ONTAP 9 Documentation] center.

For information on configuring VCF refer to link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/index.html[VMware Cloud Foundation Documentation].

=== Deployment Steps
To deploy a VI Workload Domain with an NFS datastore as principal storage, complete the following steps:

.Verify networking for ONTAP SVM
[%collapsible]
==== 
Verify that the required logical interfaces have been established for the network that will carry NFS traffic between the ONTAP storage cluster and VI Workload Domain.

. From ONTAP System Manager navigate to *Storage VMs* in the left-hand menu and click on the SVM to be used for NFS traffic. On the *Overview* tab, under *NETWORK IP INTERFACES*, click on the numeric to the right of *NFS*. In the list verify that the required LIF IP addresses are listed.
+

Alternately, verify the LIFs associated with an SVM from the ONTAP CLI with the following command:

[source, cli]
network interface show -vserver <SVM_NAME>

. Verify that the ESXi hosts can communicate to the ONTAP NFS Server. Log into the ESXi host via SSH and ping the SVM LIF:

[source, cli]
vmkping <IP Address>

[NOTE]
When deploying a VI Workload Domain, VCF validates connectivity to the NFS Server. This is done using the management adapter on the ESXi hosts before any additional vmkernel adapter is added with the NFS IP address. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that either 1) the management network is routable to the NFS Server, or 2) a LIF for the management network has been added to the SVM hosting the NFS datastore volume, to ensure that the validation can proceed.

.Create Export Policy for sharing NFS volume
[%collapsible]
==== 
Create an export policy in ONTAP System Manager to define access control for NFS volumes.

. In ONTAP System Manager click on *Storage VMs* in the left-hand menu and select an SVM from the list.

. On the *Settings* tab locate *Export Policies* and click on the arrow to access.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image06.png[Access Export Policies]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *New export policy* window add a name for the policy, click on the *Add new rules* button and then on the *+Add* button to begin adding a new rule.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image07.png[New export policy]
+
{nbsp}
. Fill in the IP Addresses, IP address range, or network that you wish to include in the rule. Uncheck the *SMB/Cifs* and *FlexCache* boxes and make selections for the access details below. Selecting the UNIX boxes is sufficient for ESXi host access.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image08.png[Save new rule]
+
[NOTE]
When deploying a VI Workload Domain, VCF validates connectivity to the NFS Server. This is done using the management adapter on the ESXi hosts before any additional vmkernel adapter is added with the NFS IP address. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the export policy includes the VCF management network in order to allow the validation to proceed.

. Once all rules have been entered click on the *Save* button to save the new Export Policy.

. Alternately, you can create export policies and rules in the ONTAP CLI. Refer to the steps for creating an export policy and adding rules in the ONTAP documentation.
* Use the ONTAP CLI to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-config/create-export-policy-task.html[Create an export policy].
* Use the ONTAP CLI to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-config/add-rule-export-policy-task.html[Add a rule to an export policy].
