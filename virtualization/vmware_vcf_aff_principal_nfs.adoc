== NFS as principal storage for VI Workload Domains

=== Scenario Overview
In this scenario we will demonstrate how to configure NFS datastores as principal storage during the deployment of a VI Workload Domain in VCF. Where appropriate we will refer to external documentation for many of the detailed steps that must be performed in VMware Cloud Manager, and only cover those steps that are specific to the storage configuration portion.

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Verify networking for the ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM) and that a logical interface (LIF), is present to carry the NFS traffic.
* Create an export policy to allow the ESXi hosts access to the NFS volume.
* Create an NFS volume on the ONTAP storage system.
* Create a Network Pool for NFS and vMotion traffic in VCF Cloud Manager.
* During VI Workload Domain deployment configuration, specify the information to connect to the NFS volume.
* Monitor the storage validation and workload domain deployment.
* Verify that the NFS datastore was created. 

=== Prerequisites
This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* NetApp AFF storage system with a storage virtual machine (SVM) configured to allow NFS traffic.
* Logical interface (LIF) has been created on the IP network that is to carry NFS traffic and is associated with the SVM.
* VCF management domain deployment is complete and the Cloud Manager interface is accessible.
* 4 x ESXi hosts commissioned within Cloud Manager and ready for Workload Domain deployment.
* IP addresses reserved for NFS storage traffic on the VLAN or network segment established for this purpose.

[NOTE]
When deploying a VI Workload Domain, VCF validates connectivity to the NFS Server. This is done using the management adapter on the ESXi hosts before any additional vmkernel adapter is added with the NFS IP address. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that either 1) the management network is routable to the NFS Server, or 2) a LIF for the management network has been added to the SVM hosting the NFS datastore volume, to ensure that the validation can proceed.

For information on configuring ONTAP storage system refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap[ONTAP 9 Documentation] center.

For information on configuring VCF refer to link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/index.html[VMware Cloud Foundation Documentation].

=== Deployment Steps
To deploy a VI Workload Domain with an NFS datastore as principal storage, complete the following steps:

.Verify networking for ONTAP SVM
[%collapsible]
==== 
Verify that the required logical interfaces have been established for the network that will carry NFS traffic between the ONTAP storage cluster and VI Workload Domain.

. From ONTAP System Manager navigate to *Storage VMs* in the lefthand menu and click on the SVM to be used for NFS traffic. On the *Overview* tab, under *NETWORK IP INTERFACES*, click on the numeric to the right of *NFS*. In the list verify that the required LIF IP addresses are listed.

Alternately, verify the LIFs associated with an SVM from the ONTAP CLI with the following command:

[source, cli]
network interface show -vserver <SVM_NAME>

. Verify that the ESXi host can communicate to the ONTAP NFS Server. Log into the ESXi host via SSH and ping the SVM LIF:

[source, cli]
vmkping <IP Address>

[NOTE]
When deploying a VI Workload Domain, VCF validates connectivity to the NFS Server. This is done using the management adapter on the ESXi hosts before any additional vmkernel adapter is added with the NFS IP address. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that either 1) the management network is routable to the NFS Server, or 2) a LIF for the management network has been added to the SVM hosting the NFS datastore volume, to ensure that the validation can proceed.

.Create Network Pool in Cloud Manager
[%collapsible]
==== 
In VCF Cloud Manager a Network Pool must be created before commissioning the ESXi hosts, as preparation for deploying them in a VI Workload Domain. The Network Pool must include the network information and IP address range(s) for VMkernel adapters to be used for communication with the NFS server.

. From the Cloud Manager web interface navigate to *Network Settings* in the lefthand menu and click on the *+ Create Network Pool* button.

. Fill out a name for the Network Pool, select the check box for NFS and fill out all networking details. Repeat this for the vMotion networking information.

. Click the *Save* button to complete creating the Network Pool.
