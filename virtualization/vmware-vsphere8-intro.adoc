The integration of NetApp and VMware technologies has a legacy spanning 20 years and thousands of engineering hours. With the advent of vSphere 8 and ONTAP 9.12, both companies deliver products that satisfy the most demanding customer workloads.  When these products are coupled together in solutions, are real customer challenges solved whether on-premises or in the public clouds.  

To help you determine support ability of products, protocols, operating systems, etc. please review the resources below: 

* The https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool] (IMT). The IMT defines the qualified components and versions you can use to build FC/FCoE, iSCSI, NFS and CIFS configurations as well as integrations with additional plug-ins and software offerings. 

* The https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php?deviceCategory=san&details=1&partner=64&isSVA=0&page=1&display_interval=10&sortColumn=Partner&sortOrder=Asc[VMware Compatibility Guide]. The VMware Compatibility Guide lists System, I/O, Storage/SAN, Backup compatibility and much more with VMware Infrastructure and software products.
