== Use VMware Live Site Recovery for Disaster Recovery of NFS datastores
[.lead]
The utilization of ONTAP tools and the Site Replication Adapter (SRA) in conjunction with VMware Live Site Recovery Manager (VLSR) brings significant value to disaster recovery efforts. ONTAP tools provide robust storage capabilities, including native high availability and scalability for the VASA Provider, supporting iSCSI and NFS vVols. This ensures data availability and simplifies the management of multiple VMware vCenter servers and ONTAP clusters. By integrating the SRA, organizations can achieve seamless replication and failover of virtual machines and data between sites, enabling efficient disaster recovery processes. The combination of ONTAP tools and the SRA empowers businesses to protect critical workloads, minimize downtime, and maintain business continuity in the face of unforeseen events or disasters.

In this scenario we will demonstrate how to deploy and use ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere (OTV) to configure both an *NFS datastore*, and a *vVols datastore* for a VCF workload domain. 

=== Scenario Overview

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Install the SRA adapter for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 and register with vCenters.
* Create SnapMirror relationships between source and destination ONTAP storage systems
* 

Architecture

=== Prerequisites
This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* ONTAP AFF storage systems at both the primary and secondary locations, with physical data ports on ethernet switches dedicated to storage traffic.


NetApp recommends a redundant network designs for NFS, providing fault tolerance for storage systems, switches, networks adapters and host systems. It is common to deploy NFS with a single subnet or multiple subnets depending on the architectural requirements.

Refer to https://core.vmware.com/resource/best-practices-running-nfs-vmware-vsphere[Best Practices For Running NFS with VMware vSphere] for detailed information specific to VMware vSphere.

For network guidance on using ONTAP with VMware vSphere refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-apps-dbs/vmware/vmware-vsphere-network.html#nfs[Network configuration - NFS] section of the NetApp enterprise applications documentation.

This documentation demonstrates the process of creating a new SVM and specifying the IP address information to create multiple LIFs for NFS traffic. To add new LIFs to an existing SVM refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[Create a LIF (network interface)].

=== Deployment Steps
To deploy ONTAP Tools and use it to create a vVols and NFS datastore on the VCF management domain, complete the following steps:

==== Create SVM and LIFs on ONTAP storage system
The following step is performed in ONTAP System Manager.

.Create the storage VM and LIFs

==== 

Complete the following steps to create an SVM together with multiple LIFs for NFS traffic.

. From ONTAP System Manager navigate to *Storage VMs* in the left-hand menu and click on *+ Add* to start.
