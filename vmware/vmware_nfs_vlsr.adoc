[.lead]
The utilization of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 and the Site Replication Adapter (SRA) in conjunction with VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) brings significant value to disaster recovery efforts. ONTAP tools 10 provide robust storage capabilities, including native high availability and scalability for the VASA Provider, supporting iSCSI and NFS vVols. This ensures data availability and simplifies the management of multiple VMware vCenter servers and ONTAP clusters. By using the SRA with VMware Site Recovery Manager, organizations can achieve seamless replication and failover of virtual machines and data between sites, enabling efficient disaster recovery processes. The combination of ONTAP tools and the SRA empowers businesses to protect critical workloads, minimize downtime, and maintain business continuity in the face of unforeseen events or disasters.

ONTAP tools 10 simplifies storage management and efficiency features, enhances availability, and reduces storage costs and operational overhead, whether you are using SAN or NAS. It uses best practices for provisioning datastores and optimizes ESXi host settings for NFS and block storage environments. For all these benefits, NetApp recommends this plug-in when using vSphere with systems running ONTAP software.

The SRA is used together with SRM to manage the replication of VM data between production and disaster recovery sites for traditional VMFS and NFS datastores and also for the nondisruptive testing of DR replicas. It helps automate the tasks of discovery, recovery, and reprotection.

In this scenario we will demonstrate how to deploy and use VMWare Site Recovery manager to protect datastores and run both a test and final failover to a secondary site. Reprotection and failback are also discussed.

== Scenario Overview

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Configure SRM with vCenter servers at primary and secondary sites. 
* Install the SRA adapter for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 and register with vCenters.
* Create SnapMirror relationships between source and destination ONTAP storage systems
* Configure Site Recovery for SRM.
* Conduct test and final failover.
* Discuss reprotection and failback.

== Architecture
The following diagram shows a typical VMware Site Recovery architecture with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 configured in a 3-node high availability configuration.

image:vmware-nfs-srm-image05.png[Configure appliance]
{nbsp}

== Prerequisites
This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* vSphere 8 clusters installed at both the primary and secondary locations with suitable networking for communications between environments. 
* ONTAP storage systems at both the primary and secondary locations, with physical data ports on ethernet switches dedicated to NFS storage traffic.
* ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 is installed and has both vCenter servers registered.
* VMware Site Replication Manager appliances have been installed for the primary and secondary sites.
** Inventory mappings (network, folder, resource, storage policy) have been configured for SRM.

NetApp recommends a redundant network designs for NFS, providing fault tolerance for storage systems, switches, networks adapters and host systems. It is common to deploy NFS with a single subnet or multiple subnets depending on the architectural requirements.

Refer to https://core.vmware.com/resource/best-practices-running-nfs-vmware-vsphere[Best Practices For Running NFS with VMware vSphere] for detailed information specific to VMware vSphere.

For network guidance on using ONTAP with VMware vSphere refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-apps-dbs/vmware/vmware-vsphere-network.html#nfs[Network configuration - NFS] section of the NetApp enterprise applications documentation.

== Deployment Steps
The following sections outline the deployment steps to implement and test a VMware Site Recovery Manager configuration with ONTAP storage system.

=== Create SnapMirror relationship between ONTAP storage systems
A SnapMirror relationship must be established between the source and destination ONTAP storage systems, for the datastore volumes to be protected.

Refer to ONTAP documentation starting https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/snapmirror-replication-workflow-concept.html[HERE] for complete information on creating SnapMirror relationships for ONTAP volumes.

Step-by-step instructions are outline in the following document, located link:../ehc/aws-guest-dr-solution-overview.html#assumptions-pre-requisites-and-component-overview[HERE]. These steps outline how to create cluster peer and SVM peer relationships and then SnapMirror relationships for each volume. These steps can be performed in ONTAP System Manager or using the ONTAP CLI.

== Disaster recovery operations with SRM
In this section various functions of using disaster recovery with SRM will be covered including, testing failover, performing failover, performing reprotection and failback.

Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-apps-dbs/vmware/vmware-srm-operational_best_practices.html[Operational best practices] for more information on using ONTAP storage with SRM disaster recovery operations.

.Testing failover with SRM
[%collapsible]
==== 
The following step is completed in the Site Recovery interface.

====

Additional functions are possible in SRM once a failover has completed.

*Reprotection*: Once the recovery process is complete, the previously designated recovery site assumes the role of the new production site. However, it's important to note that the SnapMirror replication is disrupted during the recovery operation, leaving the new production site vulnerable to future disasters. To ensure continued protection, it is recommended to establish new protection for the new production site by replicating it to another site. In cases where the original production site remains functional, the VMware administrator can repurpose it as a new recovery site, effectively reversing the direction of protection. It's crucial to highlight that re-protection is only feasible in non-catastrophic failures, necessitating the eventual recoverability of the original vCenter Servers, ESXi servers, SRM servers, and their respective databases. If these components are unavailable, the creation of a new protection group and a new recovery plan becomes necessary.

*Failback*: A failback operation is a reverse failover, returning operations to the original site. It's crucial to ensure that the original site has regained functionality before initiating the failback process. To ensure a smooth failback, it's recommended to conduct a test failover after completing the reprotection process and before executing the final failback. This practice serves as a verification step, confirming that the systems at the original site are fully capable of handling the operation. By following this approach, you can minimize risks and ensure a more reliable transition back to the original production environment.
