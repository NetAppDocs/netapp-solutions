[.lead]

With the release of VMware Virtual Cloud Foundation (VCF) comes the capability to convert existing vSphere 8 clusters to VCF management domains and import additional clusters as VCF VI workload domains. Converting a cluster, with an existing NFS datastore running on ONTAP, involves integrating existing infrastructure into a modern private cloud architecture. This process benefits from the flexibility of NFS storage, to ensure seamless data access and management. After a VCF management domain is established through the conversion process, administrators can efficiently import additional vSphere clusters, including those using NFS datastores, into the VCF ecosystem. This integration not only enhances resource utilization but also simplifies the management of private cloud infrastructure, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal disruption to existing workloads.

In this solution we will demonstrate how an NFS datastore in vSphere 8 becomes principal storage when the cluster is converted to a VCF management domain.

== Scenario Overview

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.
* Provision an NFS datastore using ONTAP tools.
* Deploy the SDDC Manager in the vSphere cluster.
* Use the VCF Import Tool to validate the vSphere cluster.
* Configure a JSON file for create an NSX during the VCF conversion.
* Use the VCF Import Tool to convert the vSphere 8 cluster to VCF 5.2.

== Prerequisites

This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* NetApp AFF storage system with a storage virtual machine (SVM) configured to allow NFS traffic.
* Logical interface (LIF) has been created on the IP network that is to carry NFS traffic and is associated with the SVM.
* A vSphere 8 cluster with 4 x ESXi hosts and a vCenter appliance colocated on the cluster.
* Distributed port group configured for vMotion and NFS storage traffic on the VLANs or network segments established for this purpose.
* Download software required for the VCF conversion.

ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 can be installed in either HA or non-HA configurations. For complete information on prerequsites for ONTAP tools refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/deploy/prerequisites.html#system-requirements[Prerequisites for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere deployment].
