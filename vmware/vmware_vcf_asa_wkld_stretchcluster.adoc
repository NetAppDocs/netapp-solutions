= Stretch Cluster with ONTAP for VCF VI Workload Domains

[.lead]
In this scenario we will demonstrate how to use ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere (OTV) to configure a stretch cluster for a VCF VI workload domain.

== Scenario Overview

The datastores on VCF Workload domain can be protected with SnapMirror active sync to provide stretch cluster solution. The protection is enabled at vSphere cluster level and all ONTAP block datastores in the cluster will be protected.


// == Prerequisites

.Principal storage on Workload Domain
[%collapsible]
==== 
Workload domain can be created either importing using the VCF import tool or deploy using the SDDC manager. Deploying with SDDC manager will provide more networking options than importing an existing environment.

. Create Workload domain with VMFS on FC

NOTE: Whenever the cluster is expanded or shrank, need to update the Host Cluster relationship on ONTAP tools for the cluster to indicate the changes made to source or target.
====

.Supplemental storage on Workload Domain
[%collapsible]
==== 
Once the workload domain is up and running, additional datastores can be created using ONTAP tools which will trigger the consistency group expansion. 

TIP: If a vSphere cluster is protected, all the datastores in the cluster will be protected.
