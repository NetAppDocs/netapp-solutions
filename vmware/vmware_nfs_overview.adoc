== Technology Overview
The NFS 3.1 VCF Reference Guide for vSphere 8 is comprised of the following major components:

=== VMware vSphere Foundation

A central component of vSphere Foundation, VMware vCenter is a centralized management platform for providing configuration, control and administration of vSphere environments. vCenter acts as the base for managing virtualized infrastructures, allowing administrators to deploy, monitor and manage VMs, containers, and ESXi hosts within the virtual environment. 

The VVF solution supports both native Kubernetes and virtual machine-based workloads. Key components include: 

* VMware vSphere
* VMware vSAN
* Aria Standard
* VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service for vSphere
* vSphere Distributed Switch

For more information on VVF included components, refer to  architecture and planning, refer to https://www.vmware.com/docs/vmw-datasheet-vsphere-product-line-comparison[VMware vSphere Product Live Comparison].

=== VVF Storage Options
Central to a successful and powerful virtual environment is storage. Storage whether through VMware datastores or guest-connected use cases, unlocks the capabilities of your workloads as you can pick the best price per GB that delivers the most value while also reducing underutilization. ONTAP has been a leading storage solution for VMware vSphere environments for almost two decades and continues to add innovative capabilities to simplify management while reducing costs.

VMware storage options are typically organized as traditional storage and software defined storage offerings. Traditional storage models include local and networked storage while software-defined storage models include vSAN and VMware Virtual Volumes (vVols).

=== Storage considerations
Leveraging ONTAP NFS datastores with VMware vSphere yields a high-performing, easy-to-manage, and scalable environment that provides VM-to-datastore ratios unattainable with block-based storage protocols. This architecture can result in a tenfold increase in datastore density, accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the number of datastores.

*nConnect for NFS:* Another benefit of using NFS is the ability to leverage the *nConnect* feature. nConnect enables multiple TCP connections for NFS v3 datastore volumes, thereby achieving higher throughput. This helps increase parallelism and for NFS datastores. Customers deploying datastores with NFS version 3 can increase the number of connections to the NFS server, maximizing the utilization of high-speed network interface cards.

For detailed information on nConnect, refer to link:vmware-vsphere8-nfs-nconnect.html[NFS nConnect Feature with VMware and NetApp].

*Session trunking for NFS:* Starting from ONTAP 9.14.1, clients using NFSv4.1 can leverage session trunking to establish multiple connections to various LIFs on the NFS server. This enables faster data transfer and enhances resilience by utilizing multipathing. Trunking proves particularly beneficial when exporting FlexVol volumes to clients that support trunking, such as VMware and Linux clients, or when using NFS over RDMA, TCP, or pNFS protocols.

Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-trunking/[NFS trunking overview] for more information.

*FlexVol volumes:* NetApp recommends using *FlexVol* volumes for most NFS datastores. While larger datastores can enhance storage efficiency and operational benefits, it is advisable to consider using at least four datastores (FlexVol volumes) to store VMs on a single ONTAP controller. Typically, administrators deploy datastores backed by FlexVol volumes with capacities ranging from 4TB to 8TB. This size strikes a good balance between performance, ease of management, and data protection. Administrators can start small and scale the datastore as needed (up to a maximum of 100TB). Smaller datastores facilitate faster recovery from backups or disasters and can be swiftly moved across the cluster. This approach allows for maximum performance utilization of hardware resources and enables datastores with different recovery policies.

*FlexGroup volumes:* For scenarios requiring a large datastore, NetApp recommends the use of *FlexGroup* volumes. FlexGroup volumes have virtually no capacity or file count constraints, enabling administrators to easily provision a massive single namespace. Using FlexGroup volumes does not entail additional maintenance or management overhead. Multiple datastores are not necessary for performance with FlexGroup volumes, as they scale inherently. By utilizing ONTAP and FlexGroup volumes with VMware vSphere, you can establish simple and scalable datastores that leverage the full power of the entire ONTAP cluster..  

=== Ransomware protection

NetApp ONTAP data management software features a comprehensive suite of integrated technologies to help you protect, detect, and recover from ransomware attacks. The
NetApp SnapLock Compliance feature built into ONTAP prevents the deletion of data stored in an enabled volume using WORM (write once, read many) technology with
advanced data retention. After the retention period is established and the Snapshot copy is locked, not even a storage administrator with full system privileges or a member of the NetApp Support team can delete the Snapshot copy. But, more importantly, a hacker with compromised credentials canâ€™t delete the data. 

NetApp guarantees that we will be able to recover your protected NetAppÂ® Snapshotâ„¢ copies on eligible arrays, and if we canâ€™t, we will compensate your organization. 

More information about the Ransomware Recovery Guarantee, see: https://www.netapp.com/media/103031-SB-4279-Ransomware_Recovery_Guarantee.pdf[Ransomeware Recovery Guarantee].

Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview] for more in depth information.

=== Disaster recovery considerations

NetApp provides the most secure storage on the planet. NetApp can help protect data and application infrastructure, move data between on-premises storage and cloud, and help ensure data availability across clouds. ONTAP comes with powerful data protection and security technologies that help protect customers from disasters by proactively detecting threats and quickly recovering data and applications. 

*VMware Live Site Recovery*, formerly known as VMware Site Recovery Manager, offers streamlined, policy-based automation for protecting virtual machines within the vSphere web client. This solution leverages NetApp's advanced data management technologies through the Storage Replication Adapter as part of ONTAP Tools for VMware. By harnessing the capabilities of NetApp SnapMirror for array-based replication, VMware environments can benefit from one of ONTAP's most reliable and mature technologies. SnapMirror ensures secure and highly efficient data transfers by copying only the changed file system blocks, rather than entire VMs or datastores. Moreover, these blocks take advantage of space-saving techniques like deduplication, compression, and compaction. With the introduction of version-independent SnapMirror in modern ONTAP systems, you gain flexibility in selecting your source and destination clusters. SnapMirror has truly emerged as a powerful tool for disaster recovery, and when combined with Live Site Recovery, it offers enhanced scalability, performance, and cost savings compared to local storage alternatives.

For more information refer to the https://docs.vmware.com/en/Site-Recovery-Manager/8.8/srm-installation-and-configuration/GUID-C1E9E7D0-B88F-4D2E-AA15-31897C01AB82.html[Overview of VMware Site Recovery Manager].
