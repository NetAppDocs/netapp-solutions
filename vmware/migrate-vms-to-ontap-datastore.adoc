[.lead]
VMware vSphere by Broadcom supports VMFS, NFS, and vVol datastores for hosting virtual machines. Customers have the option to create those datastores with hyper converged infrastructures or with centralized shared storage systems. Customers often see the value with hosting on ONTAP based storage systems to provide space efficient snapshots and clones of Virtual machines, flexibility to choose various deployment models across the datacenters and clouds, operational efficiency with monitoring and alerting tools, security, governance and optional compliance tools to inspect VM data, etc,.

VMs hosted on ONTAP datastores can be protected using SnapCenter Plugin for VMware vSphere (SCV). SCV creates storage based snapshots and also replicates to remote ONTAP storage system. Restores can be performed either from Primary or Secondary storage systems.

Customers has flexibility to choose Cloud Insights or Aria Operations or combination of both or other third party tools that use ONTAP api to troubleshoot, performance monitoring, reporting and alert notification features.

Customers can easily provision datastore using ONTAP Tools vCenter Plug-in or its API and VMs can be migrated to ONTAP datastores even while it is powered on.

[NOTE]
Some VMs which are deployed with external management tool like Aria Automation, Tanzu (or other Kubernetes flavors) are usually depends on VM storage policy. If migrating between the datastores within same VM storage policy, it should be of less impact for the applications. Check with Application owners to properly migrate those VMs to new datastore. vSphere 8 introduced https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/8-0/how-to-prepare-an-application-for-vsphere-vmotion.html#:~:text=vSphere%208.0%20introduces%20a%20notification,the%20necessary%20steps%20to%20prepare.[vSphere vMotion Notifications for Latency Sensitive Applications] to prepare applications for vMotion.

== Network Requirements
.VM migration with vMotion
[%collapsible%open]
==== 
It is assumed that dual storage network is already in place for the ONTAP datastore to provide connectivity, fault tolerance and performance boost.

Migration of VMs across the vSphere hosts are also handled by the VMKernel interface of the vSphere host. For hot migration (powered on VMs), VMKernel interface with vMotion enabled service is used and for cold migration (powered off VMs), VMKernel interface with Provisioning service enabled is consumed to move the data. If no valid interface was found, it will use the management interface to move the data which may not be desirable for certain use cases.

image:migrate-vms-to-ontap-image02.png[VMKernel with enabled services]

When you edit the VMKernel interface, here is the option to enable the required services.

image:migrate-vms-to-ontap-image01.png[VMKernel service options]

[TIP]
Ensure at least two high-speed active uplink nics are available for the portgroup used by vMotion and Provisioning VMkernel interfaces.

== VM Migration Scenarios

vMotion is often used to migrate the VMs irrespective of its power state. Additional considerations and migration procedure for specific scenarios is available below.

[NOTE]
Understand https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/8-0/vcenter-and-host-management-8-0/migrating-virtual-machines-host-management/migration-with-vmotion-host-management/virtual-machine-conditions-and-limitation-for-vmotion-host-management.html[VM Conditions and Limitation of vSphere vMotion] before proceeding with any VM migration options.

.Migration of VMs from specific vSphere Datastore

Follow the procedure below to migrate VMs to new Datastore using UI.

. With vSphere Web Client, select the Datastore from the storage inventory and click on VMs tab.
+
image:migrate-vms-to-ontap-image03.png[VMs on specific datastore]
+
. Select the VMs that needs to be migrated and right click to select Migrate option.

To migrate VMs using PowerCLI, here is the sample script.

[source,powershell]
----
#Authenticate to vCenter
Connect-VIServer -server vcsa.sddc.netapp.local -force

# Get all VMs with filter applied for a specific datastore 
$vm = Get-DataStore 'vSanDatastore' | Get-VM Har*

#Gather VM Disk info
$vmdisk = $vm | Get-HardDisk

#Gather the desired Storage Policy to set for the VMs. Policy should be available with valid datastores.
$storagepolicy = Get-SPBMStoragePolicy 'NetApp Storage'

#set VM Storage Policy for VM config and its data disks.
$vm, $vmdisk | Get-SPBMEntityConfiguration | Set-SPBMEntityConfiguration -StoragePolicy $storagepolicy

#Migrate VMs to Datastore specified by Policy
$vm | Move-VM -Datastore (Get-SPBMCompatibleStorage -StoragePolicy $storagepolicy)

[TIP]
When Datastore Cluster is in use with fully automated storage DRS (Dynamic Resource Scheduling) and both (source & target) datastores are of same type (VMFS/NFS/vVol), Keep both datastores in same storage cluster and migrate VMs from source datastore by enabling maintenance mode on the source. Experience will be similar to how compute hosts are handled for maintenance.

== VM Template Migration Scenarios

VM Templates can be managed by vCenter Server or by a content library. Distribution of VM templates, OVF and OVA templates, other types of files are handled by publishing it in local content library and remote content libraries can subscribe to it. 

* VM templates stored on vCenter inventory can be converted to VM and use the VM migration options.
* OVF and OVA templates, other types of files stored on content library can be cloned to other content libraries.
* Content library VM Templates can be hosted on any datastore and needs to be added into new content library.

* Migrate VMs from each vSphere Cluster to target workload domain.
[NOTE]
To allow network communication with existing VMs on other clusters on source vCenter, either extend NSX segment by adding the source vcenter vSphere hosts to transport zone or use L2 bridge on edge to allow L2 communication in VLAN.
