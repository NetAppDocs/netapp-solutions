VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) supports a wide range of supplemental storage options for expanding storage on VCF management and VI workload domains. 

NetApp's ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere provide an efficient solution for this expansion by integrating NetApp storage seamlessly into the VCF environment. ONTAP Tools simplify the setup and management of datastores, allowing administrators to provision and manage storage directly from the vSphere Client. ONTAP's advanced features such as snapshots, cloning, and data protection, enhancing storage performance, efficiency, and scalability within the VCF environment.
