[.lead]
ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 features a next-generation architecture that enables native high availability and scalability for the VASA Provider (supporting iSCSI and NFS vVols). This simplifies the management of multiple VMware vCenter servers and ONTAP clusters.

In this scenario we will demonstrate how to deploy and use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 and configure an NFS datastore for vSphere 8. 

== Solution Overview

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Create a storage virtual machine (SVM) with logical interfaces (LIFs) for NFS traffic.
* Create a distributed port group for the NFS network on the vSphere 8 cluster.
* Create a vmkernel adapter for NFS on the ESXi hosts in the vSphere 8 cluster.
* Deploy ONTAP tools 10 and register with the vSphere 8 cluster.
* Create a new NFS datastore on the vSphere 8 cluster.

== Architecture

The following diagram shows the architectural components of an ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 implementation.

image:vmware-nfs-otv10-image29.png[otv10 architecture]

== Prerequisites
This solution requires the following components and configurations:

* An ONTAP AFF storage system with physical data ports on ethernet switches dedicated to storage traffic.
* vSphere 8 cluster deployment is complete and the vSphere client is accessible.
* ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 OVA template has been downloaded from the NetApp support site.

NetApp recommends a redundant network designs for NFS, providing fault tolerance for storage systems, switches, networks adapters and host systems. It is common to deploy NFS with a single subnet or multiple subnets depending on the architectural requirements.

Refer to https://core.vmware.com/resource/best-practices-running-nfs-vmware-vsphere[Best Practices For Running NFS with VMware vSphere] for detailed information specific to VMware vSphere.

For network guidance on using ONTAP with VMware vSphere refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-apps-dbs/vmware/vmware-vsphere-network.html#nfs[Network configuration - NFS] section of the NetApp enterprise applications documentation.

Comprehensive ONTAP tools 10 resources can be found https://www.netapp.com/support-and-training/documentation/ontap-tools-for-vmware-vsphere-documentation/[ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere Documentation Resources].

== Deployment Steps
To deploy ONTAP tools 10 and use it to create an NFS datastore on the VCF management domain, complete the following steps:

=== Create SVM and LIFs on ONTAP storage system
The following step is performed in ONTAP System Manager.

.Create the storage VM and LIFs
[%collapsible]
==== 
Complete the following steps to create an SVM together with multiple LIFs for NFS traffic.

. From ONTAP System Manager navigate to *Storage VMs* in the left-hand menu and click on *+ Add* to start. 
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image01.png[Click +Add to start creating SVM]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *Add Storage VM* wizard provide a *Name* for the SVM, select the *IP Space* and then, under *Access Protocol*, click on the *SMB/CIFS, NFS, S3* tab and check the box to *Enable NFS*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image35.png[Add storage VM wizard - enable NFS]
+
TIP: It is not necessary to check the *Allow NFS client access* button here as Ontap tools for VMware vSphere will be used to automate the datastore deployment process. This includes providing client access for the ESXi hosts.
{nbsp}
. In the *Network Interface* section fill in the *IP address*, *Subnet Mask*, and *Broadcast Domain and Port* for the first LIF. For subsequent LIFs the checkbox may be enabled to use common settings across all remaining LIFs or use separate settings.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image36.png[Fill out network info for LIFs]
+
{nbsp}
. Choose whether to enable the Storage VM Administration account (for multi-tenancy environments) and click on *Save* to create the SVM.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image04.png[Enable SVM account and Finish]
====

=== Set up networking for NFS on ESXi hosts
The following steps are performed on the VI Workload Domain cluster using the vSphere client. In this case vCenter Single Sign-On is being used so the vSphere client is common across the management and workload domains.

.Create a Distributed Port Group for NFS traffic
[%collapsible]
====
Complete the following to create a new distributed port group for the network to carry NFS traffic:

. From the vSphere client , navigate to *Inventory > Networking* for the workload domain. Navigate to the existing Distributed Switch and choose the action to create *New Distributed Port Group...*.
+
image:vmware-nfs-otv10-image01.png[Choose to create new port group]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *New Distributed Port Group* wizard fill in a name for the new port group and click on *Next* to continue.

. On the *Configure settings* page fill out all settings. If VLANs are being used be sure to provide the correct VLAN ID. Click on *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image23.png[Fill out VLAN ID]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Ready to complete* page, review the changes and click on *Finish* to create the new distributed port group.

. Once the port group has been created, navigate to the port group and select the action to *Edit settings...*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image37.png[DPG - edit settings]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Distributed Port Group - Edit Settings* page, navigate to *Teaming and failover* in the left-hand menu. Enable teaming for the Uplinks to be used for NFS traffic by ensuring they are together in the *Active uplinks* area. Move any unused uplinks down to *Unused uplinks*.
+
image:vmware-nfs-otv10-image02.png[DPG - team uplinks]
+
{nbsp}
. Repeat this process for each ESXi host in the cluster.
====

.Create a VMkernel adapter on each ESXi host
[%collapsible]
====
Repeat this process on each ESXi host in the workload domain.

. From the vSphere client navigate to one of the ESXi hosts in the workload domain inventory. From the *Configure* tab select *VMkernel adapters* and click on *Add Networking...* to start.
+
image:vmware-nfs-otv10-image03.png[Start add networking wizard]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Select connection type* window choose *VMkernel Network Adapter* and click on *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image08.png[Choose VMkernel Network Adapter]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Select target device* page, choose one of the distributed port groups for NFS that was created previously.
+
image:vmware-nfs-otv10-image04.png[Choose target port group]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Port properties* page keep the defaults (no enabled services) and click on *Next* to continue.

. On the *IPv4 settings* page fill in the *IP address*, *Subnet mask*, and provide a new Gateway IP address (only if required). Click on *Next* to continue.
+ 
image:vmware-nfs-otv10-image05.png[VMkernel IPv4 settings]
+
{nbsp}
. Review the your selections on the *Ready to complete* page and click on *Finish* to create the VMkernel adapter.

=== Deploy and use ONTAP tools 10 to configure storage
The following steps are performed on vSphere 8 cluster using the vSphere client and involve deploying OTV, configuring ONTAP tools Manager, and creating a vVols NFS datastore.

For the full documentation on deploying and using ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/deploy/prepare-deployment.html[Prepare to deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere].

.Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10
[%collapsible]
==== 
ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 is deployed as a VM appliance and provides an integrated vCenter UI for managing ONTAP storage. ONTAP tools 10 features a new global management portal for managing connections to multiple vCenter servers and ONTAP storage backends.

NOTE: In a non-HA deployment scenario, three available IP addresses are required. One IP address is allocated for the load balancer, another for the Kubernetes control plane, and the remaining one for the node. In an HA deployment, two additional IP addresses are necessary for the second and third nodes, in addition to the initial three. Prior to assignment, the host names should be associated to the IP addresses in DNS. It is important that all five IP addresses are on the same VLAN, which is chosen for the deployment.

Complete the following to Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere:

. Obtain the ONTAP tools OVA image from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv10/downloads-tab[NetApp Support site] and download to a local folder.
