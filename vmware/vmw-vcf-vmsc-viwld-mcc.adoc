== Introduction

In this solution we will demonstrate how to implement Stetched VCF VI Workload Domain with NFS as Principal Datastore using ONTAP MetroCluster. The VI Workload Domain can be deployed using SDDC Manager or import an existing vSphere environment as VI Workload Domain.

== Scenario Overview

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Deploy vSphere hosts and vCenter server.
* Provision NFS datastore to vSphere hosts.
* Use the VCF Import Tool to validate the vSphere cluster.
* Configure a JSON file for create an NSX during the VCF conversion.
* Use the VCF Import Tool to import the vSphere 8 environment as VCF VI Workload domain to an existing VCF Management Domain.

== Prerequisites

This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* Supported ONTAP MetroCluster configuration
* Storage virtual machine (SVM) configured to allow NFS traffic.
* Logical interface (LIF) has been created on the IP network that is to carry NFS traffic and is associated with the SVM.
* A vSphere 8 cluster with 4 x ESXi hosts connected to network switch.
* Download software required for the VCF conversion.

Here is the sample screenshot from System Manager showing MetroCluster configuration.

=== Deploy vSphere hosts and vCenter

Deploy vSphere on hosts using ISO downloaded from Broadcom support portal or use existing deployment option for vSphere host.

.Mount NFS Datastore to host VMs
[%collapsible%open]
==== 
In this step, We create the NFS volume and mount it as Datastore to host VMs.

. Using System Manager, Create a volume and attach to export policy that includes the IP subnet of the vSphere host.
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-viwld-mcc-image03.png[NFS volume creation with System Manager]
+
. SSH to vSphere host and mount the NFS Datastore.
[source,cli]

[NOTE] If hardware acceleration is shown as not supported, ensure latest NFS VAAI component (downloaded from NetApp Support portal) is installed on the vSphere host 
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-mgmt-mcc-image05.png[Install NFS VAAI component]
and vStorage is enabled on the SVM that hosts the volume.
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-mgmt-mcc-image04.png[Enable vStorage on SVM for VAAI]
. Repeat above steps for additional datastore need and ensure the hardware acceleration is supported.

====
Deploy vCenter on NFS Datastore. Ensure SSH and Bash shell is enabled on vCenter appliance.
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-viwld-mcc-image04.png[Before VCF convert]

=== Create vSphere Cluster

. Login to vSphere webclient, Create the DataCenter and vSphere Cluster by adding one of the host where NFS VAAI is deployed. We opted to Manage all hosts in the cluster with single image option.
[TIP] Do not select Manage configuration at cluster level.

=== Convert vSphere environment to VCF VI Workload Domain

The following section covers the steps to deploy the SDDC manager and convert the vSphere 8 cluster to a VCF 5.2 management domain. Where appropriate, VMware documentation will be referred to for additional detail.

The VCF Import Tool, from VMware by Broadcom is a utility that is used on both the vCenter appliance and SDDC manager to validate configurations and provide conversion and import services for vSphere and VCF environments.

For more information, refer to https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/5.2/vcf-admin/GUID-44CBCB85-C001-41B2-BBB4-E71928B8D955.html[VCF Import Tool Options and Parameters].

.Copy and extract VCF Import Tool
[%collapsible%open]
====
The VCF Import Tool is used on the vCenter appliance to validate that the vSphere cluster is in a healthy state for the VCF conversion or import process.

Complete the following steps:

. Follow the steps at https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/5.2/vcf-admin/GUID-6ACE3794-BF52-4923-9FA2-2338E774B7CB.html[Copy the VCF Import Tool to the Target vCenter Appliance] at VMware Docs to copy the VCF Import Tool to the correct location.

. Extract the bundle using the following command:
+
....
tar -xvf vcf-brownfield-import-<buildnumber>.tar.gz
....
====

.Validate the vCenter appliance
[%collapsible%open]
==== 
Use the VCF Import tool to validate the vCenter appliance before the import as VI Workload Domain.

. Follow the steps at https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/5.2/vcf-admin/GUID-AC6BF714-E0DB-4ADE-A884-DBDD7D6473BB.html[Run a Precheck on the Target vCenter Before Conversion] to run the validation.

====

.Create a JSON file for NSX deployment      
[%collapsible%open]
==== 
To deploy NSX Manager while importing or converting a vSphere environment into VMware Cloud Foundation, create an NSX deployment specification. NSX deployment requires a minimum of 3 hosts.

NOTE: When deploying an NSX Manager cluster in a convert or import operation, NSX VLAN backed segment is used. For details on the limitations of NSX-VLAN backed segment, refer to the section "Considerations Before Converting or Importing Existing vSphere Environments into VMware Cloud Foundation. For information about NSX-VLAN networking limitations, refer to https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-5-2-and-earlier/5-2/map-for-administering-vcf-5-2/importing-existing-vsphere-environments-admin/considerations-before-converting-or-importing-existing-vsphere-environments-into-vcf-admin.html[Considerations Before Converting or Importing Existing vSphere Environments into VMware Cloud Foundation].

The following is an example of a JSON file for NSX deployment:
....
{
  "deploy_without_license_keys": true,
  "form_factor": "small",
  "admin_password": "****************",
  "install_bundle_path": "/nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/bundle/bundle-133764.zip",
  "cluster_ip": "10.61.185.105",
  "cluster_fqdn": "mcc-wld01-nsx.sddc.netapp.com",
  "manager_specs": [{
    "fqdn": "mcc-wld01-nsxa.sddc.netapp.com",
    "name": "mcc-wld01-nsxa",
    "ip_address": "10.61.185.106",
    "gateway": "10.61.185.1",
    "subnet_mask": "255.255.255.0"
  },
  {
    "fqdn": "mcc-wld01-nsxb.sddc.netapp.com",
    "name": "mcc-wld01-nsxb",
    "ip_address": "10.61.185.107",
    "gateway": "10.61.185.1",
    "subnet_mask": "255.255.255.0"
  },
  {
    "fqdn": "mcc-wld01-nsxc.sddc.netapp.com",
    "name": "mcc-wld01-nsxc",
    "ip_address": "10.61.185.108",
    "gateway": "10.61.185.1",
    "subnet_mask": "255.255.255.0"
  }]
}
....

Copy the JSON file to vcf user home folder on the SDDC Manager.
====

.Upload software to SDDC Manager
[%collapsible%open]
====
Copy the VCF Import Tool to home folder of vcf user and the NSX deployment bundle to /nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/bundle/ folder on the SDDC Manager.

See https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-5-2-and-earlier/5-2/map-for-administering-vcf-5-2/importing-existing-vsphere-environments-admin/convert-or-import-a-vsphere-environment-into-vmware-cloud-foundation-admin/seed-software-on-sddc-manager-admin.html[Upload the Required Software to the SDDC Manager Appliance] for detailed instructions.
====

.Detailed Check on vCenter before conversion
[%collapsible%open]
====
Before you perform a management domain convert operation or a VI workload domain import operation, you must perform a detailed check to ensure that the existing vSphere environment's configuration is supported for convert or import.
. SSH to the SDDC Manager appliance as user vcf.
. Navigate to the directory where you copied the VCF Import Tool. 
. Run the following command to check that the vSphere environment can be converted 
....
python3 vcf_brownfield.py check --vcenter '<vcenter-fqdn>' --sso-user '<sso-user>' --sso-password '********' --local-admin-password '****************' --accept-trust
....
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-viwld-mcc-image08.png[VCF check VC]
====

.Convert vSphere cluster to VCF VI Workload domain
[%collapsible%open]
====
The VCF Import Tool is used to conduct the conversion process.


The following command is run to convert the vSphere cluster to a VCF management domain and deploy the NSX cluster:
....
python3 vcf_brownfield.py import --vcenter '<vcenter-fqdn>' --sso-user '<sso-user>' --sso-password '******' --vcenter-root-password '********' --local-admin-password '****************' --backup-password '****************' --domain-name '<Mgmt-domain-name>' --accept-trust --nsx-deployment-spec-path /home/vcf/nsx.json
....

Even multiple Datastores are available on vSphere host, there is no need to prompt which Datastore that needs to be considered as Primary Datastore.

For complete instructions, refer to https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-5-2-and-earlier/5-2/map-for-administering-vcf-5-2/importing-existing-vsphere-environments-admin/convert-or-import-a-vsphere-environment-into-vmware-cloud-foundation-admin.html[VCF Convert Procedure].

NSX VMs will be deployed to vCenter.
