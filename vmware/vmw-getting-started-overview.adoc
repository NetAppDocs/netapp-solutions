*Introduction*

NetApp ONTAP is a leading storage solution for VMware vSphere environments and has been so for almost two decades. NetApp continues to add innovative capabilities to simplify storage management while reducing costs and increasing confidence in a consolidated, VMware-based virtual infrastructure that is cloud-ready. This collection of solutions introduces ONTAP offerings for VMware vSphere Foundation and VMware Cloud Foundation, including the latest product information and best practices, to streamline deployment, reduce risk, and simplify management.

For more information on using ONTAP with VMware vSphere, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-apps-dbs/vmware/vmware-vsphere-overview.html[VMware vSphere with ONTAP].

*Why ONTAP for VMware*

There are many reasons why tens of thousands of customers have selected ONTAP as their storage solution for vSphere, such as a unified storage system supporting both SAN and NAS protocols, robust data protection capabilities using space-efficient snapshots and a wealth of tools to help you manage application data. Using a storage system separate from the hypervisor allows you to offload many functions and maximize your investment in vSphere host systems. This approach not only makes sure your host resources are focused on application workloads, but it also avoids random performance effects on applications from storage operations.

Using ONTAP together with vSphere is a great combination that lets you reduce host hardware and VMware software expenses. You can also protect your data at lower cost with consistent high performance. Because virtualized workloads are mobile, you can explore different approaches using Storage vMotion to move VMs across VMFS, NFS, or vVols datastores, all on the same storage system.

Here are key benefits for NetApp and VMware customers:

* *Flexibility on day 1 and as you scale.* The need to grow can arise for a variety of reasons with any architecture. Whether performance or capacity needs evolve, or as new host are added and network or fabric considerations arise, it is critical to choose a storage platform that allows for independent scaling of resources. 
+
With ONTAP, you can start with the capacity required, grow as needed and take advantage of tiering all without having to add additional compute hosts. Additionally, a single ONTAP cluster can be used with multiple workload domains and avoids the creation of storage islands. These benefits yield significant cost savings for organization. 

* *Offload storage tasks to ONTAP.* With typical HCI environments, the host platform is responsible for compute tasks, storage operations and any network optimization on the client side. For example, CPU overhead needs to be considered when determining the hardware requirements of the compute nodes. Often difficult to preemptively scope, this overhead is commonly accepted as 10-15% and is dependent on the I/O profile of the workloads. Additionally, it is important to consider memory consumption. Memory overhead is mandatory and shouldnâ€™t be compromised to maintain performance. Hosts can offset this by taking advantage of RDMA-capable NICs, improving network transfer efficiency, at additional costs. Finally, with an HCI platform, storage functions such as storage efficiency, RAID and failure tolerances, and encryption are handled by the hosts.
+
Customers can mitigate any of these detrimental impacts on host CPU resources by leveraging ONTAP. This strategy enables hosts to focus on compute tasks while allowing ONTAP to manage the CPU-intensive storage operations. This strategy enhances overall performance by optimizing storage efficiency, encryption, snapshots, and more, all while reducing the total cost of ownership. By not only boosting host performance and decreasing the number of hosts needed to deliver the same workload, it also reduces the number of cores required per host, leading to further cost savings. These savings further extend to energy efficiency savings, reduced cooling requirements, optimized license costs and more; all by offloading CPU-intensive storge tasks to ONTAP and relying less on hosts to handle everything. 

* *Storage Efficiency*  Although NetApp was the first to deliver deduplication for production workloads, this innovation wasn't the first or last one in this area. It started with snapshots, a space-efficient data protection mechanism with no performance effect, along with FlexClone technology to instantly make read/write copies of VMs for production and backup use. NetApp went on to deliver inline capabilities, including deduplication, compression, and zero-block deduplication, to squeeze out the most storage from expensive SSDs. Most recently, ONTAP added the ability to pack smaller I/O operations and files into a disk block using compaction. The combination of these capabilities has resulted in customers seeing savings of up to 5:1 for VSI and up to 30:1 for VDI.

* *Enterprise-grade data availability.* The protection of data is paramount for any IT organization. Planning for workload fault tolerances requires careful consideration to ensure an adequate number of nodes are available when hosts are responsible for storage operations. As the number of faults tolerated increases, as does the need for additional hosts and the amount of storage provisioned to accommodate the required VM storage capacity. 
+
ONTAP's comprehensive availability features ensure that data is always accessible, secure, and resilient, making it a reliable choice for VMware deployments of all sizes. Leveraging shared storage in VMware environments facilitates the deployment of smaller vSphere clusters, streamlining the setup process and enabling storage sharing across clusters with enhanced fault tolerance. 
+
Key ONTAP availability features include:

** High Availability (HA) Architecture: ONTAP supports a high-availability architecture that includes a clustered deployment model. 
** Automatic Failover and Failback: In the event of hardware or software failures, ONTAP allows for automatic failover to a standby storage node. Once the issue is resolved, failback can be performed to restore the original configuration, minimizing downtime.
** Built in data protection: ONTAP includes built-in data protection features such as RAID-DP and RAID-TEC, which provide enhanced protection against disk failures and ensure data integrity and availability.

* *Efficient backup and recovery operations.* In addition to protecting data in the event of various faults, we must plan to backup VMs and workloads as part of regular IT operations. Snapshots capture the state of a VM at a specific point in time, including the VM's disk, memory, and settings. This allows an administrator to revert the VM to a previous state if something goes wrong, such as a failed update, configuration change or falling victim to a ransomware or virus attack. The storage consumed by snapshots should be taken into account when designing a balanced solution for VMware environments. 
+
While snapshots are an important tool, an overreliance on VMware based snapshots raises concerns with respect to frequency and retention policies. Additionally, having too many VMware based snapshots can downgrade performance. It is important to consider alternative such as NetApp snapshot copies and SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere. SnapCenter leverages snapshot copies, which are read-only, point-in-time images of a volume that initially share disk blocks with the active file system, requiring no additional space and minimal storage. These snapshots have negligible performance overhead, capturing only changes since the last snapshot.  The SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere (SCV) utilizes these snapshots to deliver efficient, crash-consistent backups and restores for VMs, Datastores, and VMDKs. These operations are integrated seamlessly and without performance impact within a vCenter environment. Additionally, ONTAP enables the offloading of snapshots to object storage for long-term retention.

* *Wholistic business continuity capabilities.* Beyond standard fault tolerance, backup and recovery, an organization must plan for various scenarios such as disasters, ransomware attacks, and data center site migrations. With host-based storage, addressing these challenges typically involves relying on a range of third-party solutions to effectively mitigate disasters and ensure business continuity. Furthermore, for scenarios that are network intensive, insufficiently sizing the networking and storage devices can lead to significant performance impacts. 
+
Building on its availability features and backup and recovery capabilities, ONTAP is an integral component of a comprehensive business continuity strategy for VMware environments. Organizations need VMs and workloads to be seamlessly available during both normal and maintenance operations, safeguarded with robust protection and recovery capabilities, and capable of leveraging space-efficient and cost-effective disaster recovery solutions.
+
Key ONTAP business continuity features include:

** Data Replication with SnapMirror: Taking advantage of snapshot copies, SnapMirror enables asynchronous and synchronous replication of data to remote sites or cloud environments for disaster recovery
** MetroCluster: ONTAP's MetroCluster technology provides synchronous replication between geographically separated sites, ensuring zero data loss and rapid recovery in the event of a site failure.
** Cloud Tiering: Cloud Tiering automatically identifies cold data (data that is infrequently accessed) on primary storage and moves it to lower-cost object storage, either in the cloud or on-premises.
** BlueXP DRaaS: NetApp BlueXP Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) is a comprehensive solution designed to provide robust disaster recovery capabilities for businesses, ensuring data protection, rapid recovery, and business continuity in the event of a disaster.
