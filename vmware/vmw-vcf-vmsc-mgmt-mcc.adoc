In this solution we will demonstrate how to implement Stetched VCF Management Domain with NFS as Principal Datastore using ONTAP MetroCluster.


== Scenario Overview

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Deploy vSphere hosts and vCenter server.
* Provision NFS datastore to vSphere hosts.
* Deploy the SDDC Manager in the vSphere cluster.
* Use the VCF Import Tool to validate the vSphere cluster.
* Configure a JSON file for create an NSX during the VCF conversion.
* Use the VCF Import Tool to convert the vSphere 8 environment to VCF management domain.

== Prerequisites

This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* Supported ONTAP MetroCluster configuration
* Storage virtual machine (SVM) configured to allow NFS traffic.
* Logical interface (LIF) has been created on the IP network that is to carry NFS traffic and is associated with the SVM.
* A vSphere 8 cluster with 4 x ESXi hosts connected to network switch.
* Download software required for the VCF conversion.

Here is the sample screenshot from System Manager showing MetroCluster configuration.

=== Deploy vSphere hosts and vCenter

Deploy vSphere on hosts using ISO downloaded from Broadcom support portal or use existing deployment option for vSphere host.

.Mount NFS Datastore to host VMs
[%collapsible%open]
==== 
In this step, We create the NFS volume and mount it as Datastore to host VMs.

. Using System Manager, Create a volume and attach to export policy that includes the IP subnet of the vSphere host.
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-mgmt-mcc-image02.png[NFS volume creation with System Manager]
+
. SSH to vSphere host and mount the NFS Datastore.
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-mgmt-mcc-image03.png[Mount NFS Datastore on vSphere host]
+
[NOTE] If hardware acceleration is shown as not supported, ensure latest NFS VAAI component (downloaded from NetApp Support portal) is installed on the vSphere host 
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-mgmt-mcc-image05.png[Install NFS VAAI component]
and vStorage is enabled on the SVM that hosts the volume.
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-mgmt-mcc-image04.png[Enable vStorage on SVM for VAAI]
. Repeat above steps for additional datastore need and ensure the hardware acceleration is supported.
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-mgmt-mcc-image06.png[List of Datastores. One from each fault domain]
====
Deploy vCenter on NFS Datastore. Ensure SSH and Bash shell is enabled on vCenter appliance.

=== Create vSphere Cluster

. Login to vSphere webclient, Create the DataCenter and vSphere Cluster by adding one of the host where NFS VAAI is deployed. We opted to Manage all hosts in the cluster with single image option.
[TIP] Do not select Manage configuration at cluster level.

====

.Create a JSON file for NSX deployment      
[%collapsible%open]
==== 
To deploy NSX Manager while importing or converting a vSphere environment into VMware Cloud Foundation, create an NSX deployment specification. NSX deployment requires a minimum of 3 hosts.

NOTE: When deploying an NSX Manager cluster in a convert or import operation, NSX VLAN backed segment is used. For details on the limitations of NSX-VLAN backed segment, refer to the section "Considerations Before Converting or Importing Existing vSphere Environments into VMware Cloud Foundation. For information about NSX-VLAN networking limitations, refer to https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-5-2-and-earlier/5-2/map-for-administering-vcf-5-2/importing-existing-vsphere-environments-admin/considerations-before-converting-or-importing-existing-vsphere-environments-into-vcf-admin.html[Considerations Before Converting or Importing Existing vSphere Environments into VMware Cloud Foundation].

The following is an example of a JSON file for NSX deployment:
....
{
  "deploy_without_license_keys": true,
  "form_factor": "small",
  "admin_password": "******************",
  "install_bundle_path": "/nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/bundle/bundle-133764.zip",
  "cluster_ip": "10.61.185.114",

    "gateway": "10.61.185.1",
    "subnet_mask": "255.255.255.0"
  },
  {
    "fqdn": "mcc-nsxb.sddc.netapp.com",
    "name": "mcc-nsxb",
    "ip_address": "10.61.185.112",
    "gateway": "10.61.185.1",
    "subnet_mask": "255.255.255.0"
  },
  {
    "fqdn": "mcc-nsxc.sddc.netapp.com",
    "name": "mcc-nsxc",
    "ip_address": "10.61.185.113",
    "gateway": "10.61.185.1",
    "subnet_mask": "255.255.255.0"
  }]
}
....

Copy the JSON file to vcf user home folder on the SDDC Manager.

====

.Detailed Check on vCenter before conversion
[%collapsible%open]
====
Before you perform a management domain convert operation or a VI workload domain import operation, you must perform a detailed check to ensure that the existing vSphere environment's configuration is supported for convert or import.
. SSH to the SDDC Manager appliance as user vcf.
. Navigate to the directory where you copied the VCF Import Tool. 
. Run the following command to check that the vSphere environment can be converted 
....
python3 vcf_brownfield.py check --vcenter '<vcenter-fqdn>' --sso-user '<sso-user>' --sso-password '********' --local-admin-password '****************' --accept-trust
....
====


.Convert vSphere cluster to VCF management domain
[%collapsible%open]
====
The VCF Import Tool is used to conduct the conversion process.


The following command is run to convert the vSphere cluster to a VCF management domain and deploy the NSX cluster:
....
python3 vcf_brownfield.py convert --vcenter '<vcenter-fqdn>' --sso-user '<sso-user>' --sso-password '******' --vcenter-root-password '********' --local-admin-password '****************' --backup-password '****************' --domain-name '<Mgmt-domain-name>' --accept-trust --nsx-deployment-spec-path /home/vcf/nsx.json
....

When multiple Datastores are available on vSphere host, it prompts which Datastore that needs to be considered as Primary Datastore on which NSX VMs will be deployed by default.
image:vmw-vcf-vmsc-mgmt-mcc-image12.png[Select Principal Datastore]
