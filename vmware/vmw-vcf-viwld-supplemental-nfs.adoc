:hardbreaks:

[.lead]
In this scenario we will demonstrate how to deploy and use ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere to configure both an *NFS datastore*, and a *vVols datastore* for a VCF workload domain. 

*NFS* is used as the storage protocol for the vVols datastore.

== Benefits of NFS

Simplicity and Ease of Use: NFS is straightforward to set up and manage, making it an excellent choice for environments that require quick and easy file sharing.

Scalability: ONTAP's architecture allows NFS to scale efficiently, supporting growing data needs without significant changes to the infrastructure.

Flexibility: NFS supports a wide range of applications and workloads, making it versatile for various use cases, including virtualized environments.

For more information, refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/vmware/vmware_nfs_overview.html[NFS v3 Reference Guide for vSphere 8].

== Scenario Overview

This scenario covers the following high level steps:

* Create a storage virtual machine (SVM) with logical interfaces (LIFs) for NFS traffic.
* Create a distributed port group for the NFS network on the VI workload domain.
* Create a vmkernel adapter for NFS on the ESXi hosts for the VI workload domain.
* Deploy ONTAP Tools on the VI workload domain.
* Create a new NFS datastore on the VI workload domain.
* Create a new vVols datastore on the VI workload domain.

// I noticed SCP creation is included. Need to include VM storage policy creation?

== Prerequisites
This scenario requires the following components and configurations:

* An ONTAP AFF storage system with physical data ports on ethernet switches dedicated to storage traffic.
* VCF management domain deployment is complete and the vSphere client is accessible.
* A VI workload domain has been previously deployed.

NetApp recommends a redundant network designs for NFS, providing fault tolerance for storage systems, switches, networks adapters and host systems. It is common to deploy NFS with a single subnet or multiple subnets depending on the architectural requirements.

Refer to https://www.vmware.com/docs/vmw-best-practices-running-nfs-vmware-vsphere[Best Practices For Running NFS with VMware vSphere] for detailed information specific to VMware vSphere.

For network guidance on using ONTAP with VMware vSphere refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-apps-dbs/vmware/vmware-vsphere-network.html#nfs[Network configuration - NFS] section of the NetApp enterprise applications documentation.

This documentation demonstrates the process of creating a new SVM and specifying the IP address information to create multiple LIFs for NFS traffic. To add new LIFs to an existing SVM refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[Create a LIF (network interface)].

== Deployment Steps
To deploy ONTAP Tools and use it to create a vVols and NFS datastore on the VCF management domain, complete the following steps:

=== Create SVM and LIFs on ONTAP storage system
The following step is performed in ONTAP System Manager.

.Create the storage VM and LIFs
[%collapsible]
==== 
Complete the following steps to create an SVM together with multiple LIFs for NFS traffic.

. From ONTAP System Manager navigate to *Storage VMs* in the left-hand menu and click on *+ Add* to start. 
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image01.png[Click +Add to start creating SVM]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *Add Storage VM* wizard provide a *Name* for the SVM, select the *IP Space* and then, under *Access Protocol*, click on the *SMB/CIFS, NFS, S3* tab and check the box to *Enable NFS*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image35.png[Add storage VM wizard - enable NFS]
+
TIP: It is not necessary to check the *Allow NFS client access* button here as Ontap Tools for VMware vSphere will be used to automate the datastore deployment process. This includes providing client access for the ESXi hosts.
{nbsp}
. In the *Network Interface* section fill in the *IP address*, *Subnet Mask*, and *Broadcast Domain and Port* for the first LIF. For subsequent LIFs the checkbox may be enabled to use common settings across all remaining LIFs or use separate settings.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image36.png[Fill out network info for LIFs]
+
{nbsp}
. Choose whether to enable the Storage VM Administration account (for multi-tenancy environments) and click on *Save* to create the SVM.
+

====

==== Set up networking for NFS on ESXi hosts
The following steps are performed on the VI Workload Domain cluster using the vSphere client. In this case vCenter Single Sign-On is being used so the vSphere client is common across the management and workload domains.

.Create a Distributed Port Group for NFS traffic
[%collapsible]
====
Complete the following to create a new distributed port group for the network to carry NFS traffic:

. From the vSphere client , navigate to *Inventory > Networking* for the workload domain. Navigate to the existing Distributed Switch and choose the action to create *New Distributed Port Group...*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image22.png[Choose to create new port group]
+
{nbsp}
. In the *New Distributed Port Group* wizard fill in a name for the new port group and click on *Next* to continue.

. On the *Configure settings* page fill out all settings. If VLANs are being used be sure to provide the correct VLAN ID. Click on *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image23.png[Fill out VLAN ID]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Ready to complete* page, review the changes and click on *Finish* to create the new distributed port group.

. Once the port group has been created, navigate to the port group and select the action to *Edit settings...*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image37.png[DPG - edit settings]
+
{nbsp}
. On *Distributed Port Group - Edit Settings* page, navigate to *Teaming and failover* in the left-hand menu. Enable teaming for the Uplinks to be used for NFS traffic by ensuring they are together in the *Active uplinks* area. Move any unused uplinks down to *Unused uplinks*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image38.png[DPG - team uplinks]
+
{nbsp}
. Repeat this process for each ESXi host in the cluster.
====

.Create a VMkernel adapter on each ESXi host
[%collapsible]
====
Repeat this process on each ESXi host in the workload domain.

. From the vSphere client navigate to one of the ESXi hosts in the workload domain inventory. From the *Configure* tab select *VMkernel adapters* and click on *Add Networking...* to start.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image30.png[Start add networking wizard]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Select connection type* window choose *VMkernel Network Adapter* and click on *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-image08.png[Choose VMkernel Network Adapter]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Select target device* page, choose one of the distributed port groups for NFS that was created previously.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image39.png[Choose target port group]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Port properties* page keep the defaults (no enabled services) and click on *Next* to continue.

. On the *IPv4 settings* page fill in the *IP address*, *Subnet mask*, and provide a new Gateway IP address (only if required). Click on *Next* to continue.
+ 
image:vmware-vcf-aff-image40.png[VMkernel IPv4 settings]

=== Deploy and use ONTAP Tools to configure storage
The following steps are performed on the VCF management domain cluster using the vSphere client and involve deploying OTV, creating a vVols NFS datastore, and migrating management VM's to the new datastore.

For VI workload domains, OTV is installed to the VCF Management Cluster but registered with the vCenter associated with the VI workload domain. 

For additional information on deploying and using ONTAP Tools in a multiple vCenter environment refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere/configure/concept_requirements_for_registering_vsc_in_multiple_vcenter_servers_environment.html[Requirements for registering ONTAP tools in multiple vCenter Servers environment].
