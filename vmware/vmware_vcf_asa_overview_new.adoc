TEST - VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is an integrated software defined data center (SDDC) platform that provides a complete stack of software-defined infrastructure for running enterprise applications in a hybrid cloud environment. It combines compute, storage, networking, and management capabilities into a unified platform, offering a consistent operational experience across private and public clouds.

Author: Josh Powell

This document provides information on storage options available for VMware Cloud Foundation using the NetApp All-Flash SAN Array. Supported storage options are covered with specific instruction for deploying iSCSI datastores as supplemental storage for management domains and both vVol (iSCSI) and NVMe/TCP datastores as supplemental datastores for workload domains. Also covered is data protection of VMs and datastores using SnapCenter for VMware vSphere.

== Use Cases
Use cases covered in this documentation:

* Storage options for customers seeking uniform environments across both private and public clouds.
// SDDC in public cloud (VMC/AVS/GCVE) doesn't have block support.
* Automated solution for deploying virtual infrastructure for workload domains.
* Scalable storage solution tailored to meet evolving needs, even when not aligned directly with compute resource requirements.
* Deploy supplemental storage to management and VI workload domains using ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere.
* Protect VMs and datastores using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following people: 

* Solution architects looking for more flexible storage options for VMware environments that are designed to maximize TCO.
* Solution architects looking for VCF storage options that provide data protection and disaster recovery options with the major cloud providers.
* Storage administrators wanting specific instruction on how to configure VCF with principal and supplemental storage.
// Replace storage admin with cloud admin?
* Storage administrators wanting specific instruction on how to protect VMs and datastores residing on ONTAP storage.
//Not sure it falls with storage admin responsibility. Feels more like cloud admin.

== Technology Overview
The VCF with NetApp ASA solution is comprised of the following major components:

=== VMware Cloud Foundation
VMware Cloud Foundation extends VMware’s vSphere hypervisor offerings by combining key components such as SDDC Manager, vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and VMware Aria Suite to create a software-defined datacenter.

The VCF solution supports both native Kubernetes and virtual machine-based workloads. Key services such as VMware vSphere, VMware vSAN, VMware NSX-T Data Center, and VMware Aria Cloud Management are integral components of the VCF package. When combined, these services establish a software-defined infrastructure capable of efficiently managing compute, storage, networking, security, and cloud management.

VCF is comprised of a single management domain and up to 24 VI workload domains that each represent a unit of application-ready infrastructure. A workload domain is comprised of one or more vSphere clusters managed by a single vCenter instance.

For more information on VCF architecture and planning, refer to link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/5.1/vcf-design/GUID-A550B597-463F-403F-BE9A-BFF3BECB9523.html[Architecture Models and Workload Domain Types in VMware Cloud Foundation].

{nbsp}

==== VCF Storage Options
VMware divides storage options for VCF into *principal* and *supplemental* storage. The VCF management domain must use vSAN as its principal storage. However, there are many supplemental storage options for the management domain and both principal and supplemental storage options available for VI workload domains.

image:vmware-vcf-aff-image01.png[VCF Storage Options]

*Principal Storage for Workload Domains*
Principal storage refers to any type of storage that can be directly connected to a VI workload domain during the setup process within SDDC Manager. Principal storage is deployed with SDDC manager as part of cluster creation orchestration and is the first datastore configured for a workload domain. It includes vSAN, vVols (VMFS), NFS and VMFS on Fibre Channel.

*Supplemental Storage for Management and Workload Domains*
Supplemental storage is the storage type that can be added to the management or workload domains at any time after the cluster has been created. Supplemental storage represents the widest range of supported storage options, all of which are supported on NetApp ASA arrays. Supplemental storage can be deployed using ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere for most storage protocol types.

==== Storage Protocol Support
The ASA supports all standard SAN protocols including, iSCSI,  Fibre Channel (FC), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and NVME over fabrics. 

*iSCSI* - NetApp ASA provides robust support for iSCSI, allowing block-level access to storage devices over IP networks. It offers seamless integration with iSCSI initiators, enabling efficient provisioning and management of iSCSI LUNs. ONTAP's advanced features, such as multi-pathing, CHAP authentication, and ALUA support.

For design guidance on iSCSI configurations refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-config/configure-iscsi-san-hosts-ha-pairs-reference.html[SAN Configuration reference documentation].

*Fibre Channel* - NetApp ASA offers comprehensive support for Fibre Channel (FC), a high-speed network technology commonly used in storage area networks (SANs). ONTAP seamlessly integrates with FC infrastructure, providing reliable and efficient block-level access to storage devices. It offers features like zoning, multi-pathing, and fabric login (FLOGI) to optimize performance, enhance security, and ensure seamless connectivity in FC environments.

==== Active-active technology
NetApp All-Flash SAN Arrays allows for active-active paths through both controllers, eliminating the need for the host operating system to wait for an active path to fail before activating the alternative path. This means that the host can utilize all available paths on all controllers, ensuring active paths are always present regardless of whether the system is in a steady state or undergoing a controller failover operation.

Furthermore, the NetApp ASA offers a distinctive feature that greatly enhances the speed of SAN failover. Each controller continuously replicates essential LUN metadata to its partner. As a result, each controller is prepared to take over data serving responsibilities in the event of a sudden failure of its partner. This readiness is possible because the controller already possesses the necessary information to start utilizing the drives that were previously managed by the failed controller.

With active-active pathing, both planned and unplanned takeovers have IO resumption times of 2-3 seconds.
