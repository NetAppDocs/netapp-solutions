| Text in column C
|===

NOTE: There are many options you can specify to change the layout of a table.  For more information, either find an example in the repository (HTML version) that you want to achieve and go to VScode to view the source or visit link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/build-a-basic-table/[AsciiDoc documentation] for more information.

== Tabbed Blocks

== Images

You can link to images within the repository or anywhere on the web.  For images within the repository, they are placed in the media folder, so you need to ensure that the ":imagesdir: ./media/" is set appropriately.

[source]
----
image::sample.jpg[Image within the repository]
----

will display:

image::sample.jpg[Image within the repository]

[source]
----
image::https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/sample-red-3d-realistic-paper-speech-bubble-isolated-on-white-gm486242045-38743744g[Image outside the repository]
----

will display:

image::https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/sample-red-3d-realistic-paper-speech-bubble-isolated-on-white-gm486242045-38743744g[Image outside the repository]

== Links

Much like images, links can reference documents inside the repository or anywhere on the web.  For internal references, it is important to ensure the path to the link source is specified in the "link::" statement.
