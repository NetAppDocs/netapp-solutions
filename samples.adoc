Included in this document are some examples of asciidoc source and the resulting output.

== Heading Levels

[blue underline]*Source AsciiDoc:*

[source]
----
= Heading level 0 (Document Title)
== Heading level 1 (Section Title)
=== Heading level 2 (Section Title)
==== Heading level 3 (Section Title)
===== Heading level 4 (Section Title)
====== Heading level 5 (Section Title)
----

[blue underline]*Generated HTML:*

= Heading level 0 (Document Title)
== Heading level 1 (Section Title)
=== Heading level 2 (Section Title)
==== Heading level 3 (Section Title)
===== Heading level 4 (Section Title)
====== Heading level 5 (Section Title)

NOTE: There should only be one Document Title (Level 0) per document and section titles can not be skipped (section sub-titles must be the next heading level under the section).

== Lists

[blue underline]*Source AsciiDoc:*

[source]
----
Unordered list:

* this is an unordered list
* this is still an unordered list
** this is a sub-element in an unordered list

Ordered list:

. this is an ordered list
. this is still an ordered list
.. this is a sub-element in an ordered list
----

== Images

You can link to images within the repository or anywhere on the web.  For images within the repository, they are placed in the media folder, so you need to ensure that the ":imagesdir: ./media/" is set appropriately.

[blue underline]*Source AsciiDoc:*

[blue underline]*Generated HTML:*

image::sample.png[Image within the repository]

[blue underline]*Source AsciiDoc:*

image::https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/8/Sample-PNG-Image.png[Image outside the repository]
----

[blue underline]*Generated HTML:*

== Links

Much like images, links can reference documents inside the repository or anywhere on the web.  For internal references, it is important to ensure the path to the link source is specified in the "link::" statement.

== Collapsible Content (a.k.a. Twisties)

[blue underline]*Source AsciiDoc:*

[source]

.Title

== Creating a Table

[blue underline]*Source AsciiDoc:*

[source]
----
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Column A | Column B | Column C
| Text in column A
| Text in column B
| Text in column C
|===
----

[blue underline]*Generated HTML:*

[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Column A | Column B | Column C
| Text in column A
| Text in column B
| Text in column C
|===

Here's another example where one row spans the entire table and other rows have data spanning across multiple columns:

[blue underline]*Source AsciiDoc:*

[source]
----
[%autowidth.stretch,cols="*,*,*,*"]
|===
| Header Column 1 | Header Column 2 | Header Column 3 | Header Column 4

4+| This is a really long row that spreads across all 4 columns of the table.  It is the only cell in this row and leaves no empty cells.
3+| This is a long row that spreads across 3 of the columns in the table leaving one empty cell | 
2+| This row spans 2 of the columns and leaves 2 cells empty | |
| This | row | is | normal
|===
----

[blue underline]*Generated HTML:*

[%autowidth.stretch,cols="*,*,*,*"]

| Header Column 1 | Header Column 2 | Header Column 3 | Header Column 4

4+| This is a really long row that spreads across all 4 columns of the table.  It is the only cell in this row and leaves no empty cells.
3+| This is a long row that spreads across 3 of the columns in the table leaving one empty cell. | 
2+| This row spans 2 of the columns and leaves 2 cells empty. | |
| This | row | is | normal
|===

NOTE: There are many options you can specify to change the layout of a table.  For more information, either find an example in the repository (HTML version) that you want to achieve and go to VScode to view the source or visit the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/build-a-basic-table/[AsciiDoc documentation] for more information.

== Tabbed Blocks

[blue underline]*Source AsciiDoc:*

[source]
----
[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.First Tab
--
Content for first tab goes here
--
.Second Tab
--
Content for second tab goes here
