Proxmox Virtual Environment is an open source Type-1 hypervisor (installed on bare metal servers) based on Debian Linux. It can host virtual machines (VM) as well as linux containers (LXC).

== Overview

Proxmox Virtual Environment(VE) supports both full VM and container based virtualization on same host. Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and Quick Emulator (QEMU) is utilized for the full VM virtualization. KVM handles compute and memory virtualization and QEMU takes care of other hardware components of virtual machine. Linux Containers (LXC) allows containers to be managed like VMs with data persistance across the reboots.

=== Cluster Management 

The web based management portal is available on Proxmox VE node at port 8006. A collection of nodes can be joined together to form a cluster. The Proxmox VE configuration (/etc/pve) is shared among all nodes of the cluster. Proxmox VE uses https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cluster_Manager[Corosync cluster engine] to manage the cluster. The management portal can be accessed from any node of the cluster.

A cluster enables VMs and Containers to be monitored and restarted on other nodes if hosting node fails. VM and containers needs to be configured for High Availability (HA). VMs and Containers can be hosted on specific subset of hosts by creating groups. The VM or container is hosted on host with highest priority. For more info, check https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/High_Availability[HA manager]

Authentication options include Linux PAM, Proxmox VE PAM, LDAP, Microsoft AD or OpenID. Permissions can be assigned via Roles and use of resource pools which is a collection of resources. For additional details, check https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-pveum.html[Proxmox User Management]

=== Storage

A virtual machine consists of a configuration file (/etc/pve/qemu-server/<vm id>.conf) and virtual disk components. Supported virtual disk formats are raw, qcow2 and VMDK. QCOW2 can provide thin provisioning and snapshot capabilities on various storage types.

LXC also has its own configuration file (/etc/pve/lxc/<container id>.conf) and container disk components. The data volume can be mounted from the supported storage types.

Support storage type includes local disk, NAS (SMB and NFS) and SAN (FC, iSCSI, NVMe-oF, etc.). For more details, check https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-pvesm.html[Proxmox VE Storage]

Every storage volume is configured with allowed content types. NAS volumes supports all content types while SAN support is limited to VM and Container images. 

NOTE: Directory storage type also supports all content types.

=== Network

Proxmox VE supports native Linux networking features like Linux bridge or Open vSwitch to implement Software Defined Networking (SDN). The Ethernet interfaces on the host can be bonded together to provide redundancy and high availability. For other options, refer https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-sysadmin.html#_choosing_a_network_configuration[Proxmox VE documentation]

Guest networks can be configured at cluster level and changes are pushed to member hosts. Seperation is managed with Zones, VNets and Subnets. https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-pvesdn.html[Zone] defines the network types like Simple,VLAN,VLAN Stacking,VXLAN,EVPN,etc.

Depending on the type of the zone, the network behaves differently and offers specific features, advantages, and limitations.

Use cases for SDN range from an isolated private network on each individual node to complex overlay networks across multiple PVE clusters on different locations.

After configuring an VNet in the cluster-wide datacenter SDN administration interface, it is available as a common Linux bridge, locally on each node, to be assigned to VMs and Containers.

=== Monitoring

The stats about hosts, guests, storage, etc. can be pushed to external Graphite or Influxdb database. For details, refer https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-sysadmin.html#external_metric_server[Proxmox VE documentation]
