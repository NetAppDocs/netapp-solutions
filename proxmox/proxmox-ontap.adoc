[.lead]
Shared storage in Proxmox Virtual Environment(VE) reduces the time for VM live migration, and makes for a better target for backups and consistent templates across the environment. ONTAP storage can serve the needs of Proxmox VE host environments as well as for guest file, block and object storage demands.

Proxmox VE hosts need to have FC, Ethernet, or other supported interfaces cabled to switches and have communication to ONTAP logical interfaces.

== High-level ONTAP Features

**Common features**

* Scale out Cluster
* Secure Authentication and RBAC support
* Zero trust multi admin support
* Secure Multitenancy
* Replicate data with SnapMirror.
* Point in time copies with Snapshots.
* Space efficient clones.
* Storage efficiency features like dedupe, compression, etc.
* Trident CSI support for Kubernetes
* Snaplock
* Tamperproof Snapshot copy locking
* Encryption support
* FabricPool to tier cold data to object store.
* BlueXP and CloudInsights Integration.
* Microsoft offloaded data transfer (ODX)

**NAS**

* FlexGroup volumes are a scale out NAS container, providing high performance along with load distribution and scalability.
* FlexCache allows data to be distributed globally and still provides local read and write access to the data.
* Multiprotocol support enables the same data to be accessible via SMB, as well as NFS.
* NFS nConnect allows multiple TCP sessions per TCP connection increasing network throughput. This increases utilization of high speed nics available on modern servers.
* NFS session trunking provides increased data transfer speeds, high availability and fault tolerance.
* SMB multichannel provides increased data transfer speed, high availability and fault tolerance.
* Integration with Active directory/LDAP for file permissions.
* Secure connection with NFS over TLS. 
* NFS Kerberos support.
* NFS over RDMA.
* Name mapping between Windows and Unix identities.
* Autonomous ransomware protection.
* File System Analytics.

**SAN**

* Stretch cluster across fault domains with SnapMirror active sync.
* ASA models provide active/active multipathing and fast path failover.
* Support for FC, iSCSI, NVMe-oF protocols.
* Support for iSCSI CHAP mutual authentication.
* Selective LUN Map and Portset.


== Proxmox VE storage types supported with ONTAP

NAS protocols (NFS/SMB) support all content types of Proxmox VE and are typically configured once at the datacenter level. Guest VMs can use disks of type raw, qcow2, or VMDK on NAS storage.
ONTAP Snapshots can be made visible, to access point in time copies of data from the client. 
Block storage with SAN protocols (FC/iSCSI/NVMe-oF) are typically configured on a per host basis and are restricted to the VM Disk and Container Image content types supported by Proxmox VE. Guest VMs and Containers consume block storage as raw devices.

*Notes:*
1 - Requires cluster filesystem to create the shared folder and use Directory storage type.
2 - use LVM storage type. 

== SMB/CIFS Storage 

To utilize SMB/CIFS file shares, there are certain tasks that needs to be carried out by the storage admin and the virtualization admin can mount the share using Proxmox VE UI or from shell. SMB multichannel provides fault tolerance and boosts performance. For more details, refer to https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/17136-tr4740.pdf[TR4740 - SMB 3.0 Multichannel]

NOTE: Password will be saved in clear text file and accessible only to root user. Refer to https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-pvesm.html#storage_cifs[Proxmox VE documentation].
