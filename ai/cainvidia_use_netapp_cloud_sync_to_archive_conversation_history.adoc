By dumping conversation history into a CSV file once a day, we can then leverage BlueXP Copy and Sync to download the log files into local storage. The following figure shows the architecture of having Jarvis deployed on-premises and in public clouds, while using BlueXP Copy and Sync to send conversation history for NeMo training. Details of NeMo training can be found in the section link:cainvidia_expand_intent_models_using_nemo_training.html[Expand Intent Models Using NeMo Training].
