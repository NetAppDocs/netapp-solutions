To install and set up the AKS cluster, see the webpage https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal[Create an AKS Cluster^] and then complete the following steps:

. When selecting the type of node (system [CPU] or worker [GPU] nodes), select the following:
.. Primary system nodes should be Standard DS2v2 (`agentpool` default three nodes).
.. Then add the worker node Standard_NC6s_v3 pool (three nodes minimum) for the user group (for GPU nodes) named `gpupool`.

. Deployment takes 5 to 10 minutes. After it is complete, click Connect to Cluster.
. To connect to the newly created AKS cluster, install the following from your local environment (laptop/pc):
.. The Kubernetes command-line tool using the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[instructions provided for your specific OS^]
.. The Azure CLI as described in the document, https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[Install the Azure CLI^]
. To access the AKS cluster from the terminal, enter `az login` and enter the credentials.
. Run the following two commands:
+

....
az account set --subscription xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
aks get-credentials --resource-group resourcegroup --name aksclustername
....

. Enter `Azure CLI: kubectl get nodes`.
. If all six nodes are up and running,  as shown in the following example, your AKS cluster is ready and connected to your local environment
