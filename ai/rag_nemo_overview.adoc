NVIDIA NeMo is an end-to-end platform for building and customizing enterprise-grade generative AI models that can be deployed anywhere, across cloud and data centers. NeMo provides microservices that simplify the generative AI development and deployment process at scale, allowing organizations to connect LLMs to their enterprise data sources. 

We have paired intelligent data infrastructure from NetApp with NVIDIA NeMo Microservices to create a solution for RAG in the enterprise. This solution is intended to serve as the foundation for a full RAG workflow that integrates into an organization's existing environment.
