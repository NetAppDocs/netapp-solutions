The NetApp AI Control Plane solution is not dependent on this specific hardware. The solution is compatible with any NetApp physical storage appliance, software-defined instance, or cloud service, that is supported by Trident. Examples include a NetApp AFF storage system, Azure NetApp Files, NetApp Cloud Volumes Service, a NetApp ONTAP Select software-defined storage instance, or a NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. Additionally, the solution can be implemented on any Kubernetes cluster as long as the Kubernetes version used is supported by Kubeflow and NetApp Trident. For a list of Kubernetes versions that are supported by Kubeflow, see the see the https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/[official Kubeflow documentation^]. For a list of Kubernetes versions that are supported by Trident, see the https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/[Trident documentation^]. See the following tables for details on the environment that was used to validate the solution.
