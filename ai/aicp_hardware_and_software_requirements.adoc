This solution is not dependent on specific hardware. The solution is compatible with any NetApp physical storage appliance, software-defined instance, or cloud service, that is supported by NetApp Trident. Examples include a NetApp AFF storage system, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, or a NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. Additionally, the solution can be implemented on any Kubernetes cluster as long as the Kubernetes version used is supported by NetApp Trident and the other solution components that are being implemented. For a list of Kubernetes versions that are supported by Trident, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/index.html[Trident documentation^]. See the following tables for details on the environments that were used to validate the various components of this solution.
