NVA-1156-DESIGN describes a NetApp Verified Architecture for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads using NetApp EF600 NVMe storage systems, the BeeGFS parallel file system, NVIDIA DGX A100 systems, and NVIDIA Mellanox Quantum QM8700 200Gbps IB switches. This design features 200Gbps InfiniBand (IB) for the storage and compute cluster interconnect fabric to provide customers with a completely IB-based architecture for high-performance workloads. This document also includes benchmark test results for the architecture as implemented.
