You can customize States and Flows of Dialog Manager for your specific use cases. In our retail example, we have the following four yaml files to direct the conversation according to different intents.

Se the following list of file names and description of each file:

* `main_flow.yml`: Defines the main conversation flows and states and directs the flow to the other three yaml files when necessary.
* `retail_flow.yml`: Contains states related to retail or points-of-interest questions. The system either provides the information of the nearest store, or the price of a given item.
* `weather_flow.yml`: Contains states related to weather questions. If the location cannot be determined, the system asks a follow up question to clarify.
* `error_flow.yml`: Handles cases where user intents do not fall into the above three yaml files. After displaying an error message, the system re-routes back to accepting user questions.The following sections contain the detailed definitions for these yaml files.
