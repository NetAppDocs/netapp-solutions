Submit jobs in the following order for `team-a`, `team-b`, and `team-c`:

|===

|1 workload queued
|team-a
|2
|4/4
|2 workloads queued
|team-b
|2
|2/2
|2 workloads queued
|team-c
|2
|2/2
|2 workloads queued
|===

See the following executed command sequence:

....
$ runai submit a-3-gg -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 2 -p team-a$ runai submit a-4-gg -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 2 -p team-a$ runai submit b-5-gg -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 2 -p team-b$ runai submit c-6-gg -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 2 -p team-c
....

At this point, you should have the following states:

|===
|Project |GPUs Allocated |Workloads Queued

|team-a
|4/4
|Two workloads asking for GPUs two each
|team-b
|2/2
|Two workloads asking for two GPUs each
|team-c
|2/2
|Two workloads asking for two GPUs each
|team-d

Next, delete all the workloads for `team-d`:

....
$ runai delete -p team-d d-1-gggg d-2-gg d-3-gg
....
