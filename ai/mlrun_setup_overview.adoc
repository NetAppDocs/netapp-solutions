Iguazio can be installed on-premises or on a cloud provider.

== Iguazio Installation

Provisioning can be done as a service and managed by Iguazio or by the customer. In both cases, Iguazio provides a deployment application (Provazio) to deploy and manage clusters.

For on-premises installation, please refer to https://www.netapp.com/us/media/nva-1121-design.pdf[NVA-1121^] for compute, network, and storage setup. On-premises deployment of Iguazio is provided by Iguazio without additional cost to the customer. See https://www.iguazio.com/docs/latest-release/intro/setup/howto/[this page^] for DNS and SMTP server configurations. The Provazio installation page is shown as follows.
