summary: For this validation, we applied Protopia obfuscation to a 1920 x 1080 pixel image five times and measured the amount of time that it took for the obfuscation step to complete each time.

For this validation, we applied Protopia obfuscation to a 1920 x 1080 pixel image five times and measured the amount of time that it took for the obfuscation step to complete each time. We used PyTorch running on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU to apply the obfuscation, and we cleared the GPU cache between runs. The obfuscation step took 5.47ms, 5.27ms, 4.54ms, 5.24ms, and 4.84ms respectively to complete across the five runs. The average speed was 5.072ms.
