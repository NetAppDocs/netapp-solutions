Organizations all over the world are currently adopting AI to transform their businesses and processes. Because of this, AI-ready compute infrastructure is often in short supply. Enterprises are adopting hybrid multicloud MLOps architectures in order to take advantage of available compute environments across different regions, data centers, and clouds - balancing cost, availability, and performance.

Domino Nexus, from Domino Data Lab, is a unified MLOps control plane that lets you run data science and machine learning workloads across any compute cluster — in any cloud, region, or on-premises. It unifies data science silos across the enterprise, so you have one place to build, deploy, and monitor models. Likewise, NetApp's hybrid cloud data management capabilities enable you to bring your data to your jobs and workspaces, no matter where they are running. When you pair Domino Nexus with NetApp, you have the flexibility to schedule workloads across environments without having to worry about data availability. In other words, you have the ability to send your workloads and your data to the appropriate compute environment, enabling you to accelerate your AI deployments while navigating regulations around data privacy and sovereignty.

This solution demonstrates the deployment of a unified MLOps control plane incorporating an on-premises Kubernetes cluster and an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster running in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
