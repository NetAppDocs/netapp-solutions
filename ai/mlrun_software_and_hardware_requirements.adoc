== Network Configuration

The following is the network configuration requirement for setting up in the cloud:

* The Iguazio cluster and NetApp Cloud Volumes must be in the same virtual private cloud.
* The cloud manager must have access to port 6443 on the Iguazio app nodes.
* We used Amazon Web Services in this technical report. However, users have the option of deploying the solution in any Cloud provider.For on-premises testing in ONTAP AI with NVIDIA DGX-1, we used the Iguazio hosted DNS service for convenience.

Clients must be able to access dynamically created DNS domains. Customers can use their own DNS if desired.

== Hardware Requirements

You can install Iguazio on-premises in your own cluster. We have verified the solution in NetApp ONTAP AI with an NVIDIA DGX-1 system. The following table lists the hardware used to test this solution.

|===
|Hardware |Quantity

|DGX-1 systems
|1
|NetApp AFF A800 system
|1 high-availability (HA) pair, includes 2 controllers and 48 NVMe SSDs (3.8TB or above)
|Cisco Nexus 3232C network switches
|2
