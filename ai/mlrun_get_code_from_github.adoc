Now that the NetApp Cloud Volume or NetApp Trident volume is available to the Iguazio cluster and the developer environment, you can start reviewing the application.

Users have their own workspace (directory). On every notebook, the path to the user directory is `/User`. The Iguazio platform manages the directory. If you follow the instructions above, the NetApp Cloud volume is available in the `/netapp` directory.

Get the code from GitHub using a Jupyter terminal.

At the Jupyter terminal prompt, clone the project.

....
cd /User
git clone .
....

You should now see the `netops- netapp` folder on the file tree in Jupyter workspace.
