To execute a single-node AI and ML job in your Kubernetes cluster, perform the following tasks from the deployment jump host. With Trident, you can quickly and easily make a data volume, potentially containing petabytes of data, accessible to a Kubernetes workload. To make such a data volume accessible from within a Kubernetes pod, simply specify a PVC in the pod definition. This step is a Kubernetes-native operation; no NetApp expertise is required.

[NOTE]
This section assumes that you have already containerized (in the Docker container format) the specific AI and ML workload that you are attempting to execute in your Kubernetes cluster.

. The following example commands show the creation of a Kubernetes job for a TensorFlow benchmark workload that uses the ImageNet dataset. For more information about the ImageNet dataset, see the http://www.image-net.org[ImageNet website^].
+
This example job requests eight GPUs and therefore can run on a single GPU worker node that features eight or more GPUs. This example job could be submitted in a cluster for which a worker node featuring eight or more GPUs is not present or is currently occupied with another workload. If so, then the job remains in a pending state until such a worker node becomes available.
+
Additionally, in order to maximize storage bandwidth, the volume that contains the needed training data is mounted twice within the pod that this job creates. Another volume is also mounted in the pod. This second volume will be used to store results and metrics. These volumes are referenced in the job definition by using the names of the PVCs. For more information about Kubernetes jobs, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/[official Kubernetes documentation^].
+
An `emptyDir` volume with a `medium` value of `Memory` is mounted to `/dev/shm` in the pod that this example job creates. The default size of the `/dev/shm` virtual volume that is automatically created by the Docker container runtime can sometimes be insufficient for TensorFlowâ€™s needs. Mounting an `emptyDir` volume as in the following example provides a sufficiently large `/dev/shm` virtual volume. For more information about `emptyDir` volumes, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/[official Kubernetes documentation^].
+
The single container that is specified in this example job definition is given a `securityContext > privileged` value of `true`. This value means that the container effectively has root access on the host. This annotation is used in this case because the specific workload that is being executed requires root access. Specifically, a clear cache operation that the workload performs requires root access. Whether or not this `privileged: true` annotation is necessary depends on the requirements of the specific workload that you are executing.
