With 100K enterprise customers and 125k network outage events per year, there was a critical need to predict and take proactive action to prevent network failures from affecting customers. This solution provided them with the following benefits:

* Predictive analytics for network failures
* Integration with a ticketing system
* Taking proactive action to prevent network failuresAs a result of this implementation of Iguazio, 60% of failures were proactively prevented.
