As RAG applications become key components of important organizational workflows, it is critical to protect the vector stores/knowledge bases that back these RAG applications. It is important to back up your vector databases and implement disaster recovery workflows just as you would for any other database.

== Protect your NeMo RAG Knowledge Base Using NetApp Technologies
NetApp technologies, such as link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/concepts/snapshot-copies-concept.html[Snapshot copies] and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/concepts/snapmirror-disaster-recovery-data-transfer-concept.html[SnapMirror disaster recovery], can be used to protect your vector store/knowledge base. For more information on vector database data protection, refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/ai/vector-database-solution-with-netapp.html[NetApp vector database solution documentation.]
