This section describes the tested configurations, the network infrastructure, the SR670 V2 server, and the NetApp storage provisioning details.

== Solution architecture

We used the solution components listed in the following table for this validation.

|===
|Solution components |Details

|Lenovo ThinkSystem servers
a|* Two SR670 V2 servers each with eight NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU cards
* Each server contains 2 Intel Xeon Platinum 8360Y CPUs (28 physical cores) and 1TB RAM
|Linux (Ubuntu â€“ 20.04 with CUDA 11.8)
|
|NetApp AFF storage system (HA pair)
a|* NetApp ONTAP 9.10.1 software
* 24x 960GB SSDs
* NFS protocol
* 1 interface group (ifgrp) per controller, with four logical IP addresses for mount points 
|===

In this validation, we used ResNet v2.0 with the ImageNet basis set as specified by MLPerf v2.0. The dataset is stored in a NetApp AFF storage system with the NFS protocol. The SR670s were connected to the NetApp AFF A400 storage system over a 100GbE switch.

ImageNet is a frequently used image dataset. It contains almost 1.3 million images for a total size of 144GB. The average image size is 108KB.

The following figure depicts the network topology of the tested configuration.

== Storage controller

The following table lists the storage configuration.

|===
|Controller |Aggregate |FlexGroup volume |Aggregate size |Volume size  |Operating system mount point

|Controller1
|Aggr1
|/a400-100g
|9.9TB
|19TB
|/a400-100g

|Controller2
|Aggr2
|/a400-100g
|9.9TB
|
|/a400-100g

[NOTE]
The /a400-100g folder contains the dataset used for ResNet validation.
