The https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-data-science-toolkit/tree/main/Kubernetes[NetApp Data Science Toolkit for Kubernetes] can be used in conjunction with Kubeflow. Using the NetApp Data Science Toolkit with Kubeflow provides the following benefits:

* Data scientists can perform advanced NetApp data management operations directly from within a Jupyter Notebook.
* Advanced NetApp data management operations can be incorporated into automated workflows using the Kubeflow Pipelines framework.

Refer to the https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-data-science-toolkit/tree/main/Kubernetes/Examples/Kubeflow[Kubeflow Examples] section within the NetApp Data Science Toolkit GitHub repository for details on using the toolkit with Kubeflow.
