TR-4915 describes how to move data from any data repository into a BeeGFS file system backed by NetApp E-Series SAN storage. For artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications, customers might routinely need to move large data sets exceeding many petabytes of data into their BeeGFS clusters for model development. This document explores how to accomplish this by using NetApp XCP and NetApp Cloud Sync tools.
