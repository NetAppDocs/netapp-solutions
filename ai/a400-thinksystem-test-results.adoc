The following table summarizes the results for all tests performed for this solution.

|===
|Test description  |Results summary 

|Image recognition training: multiple concurrent jobs
|Highly efficient performance. All jobs ran at full speed even when the cluster was fully used. The NetApp storage systems delivered training performance comparable to local SSD storage while enabling easy sharing of data between servers.
|Image recognition training: scale out
|Highly efficient for up to four nodes. At that point, scale out was less efficient but still feasible. Using a higher-speed computational network improves scalability. The NetApp storage system delivered training performance comparable to local SSD storage while enabling easy sharing of data between servers.
