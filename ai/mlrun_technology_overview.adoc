== NetApp Overview

NetApp is the data authority for the hybrid cloud. NetApp provides a full range of hybrid cloud data services that simplify management of applications and data across cloud and on-premises environments to accelerate digital transformation. Together with our partners, NetApp empowers global organizations to unleash the full potential of their data to expand customer touch points, foster greater innovation, and optimize their operations.

== NetApp ONTAP AI

NetApp ONTAP AI, powered by NVIDIA DGX systems and NetApp cloud-connected all-flash storage, streamlines the flow of data reliably and speeds up analytics, training, and inference with your data fabric that spans from edge to core to cloud. It gives IT organizations an architecture that provides the following benefits:

* Eliminates design complexities
* Allows independent scaling of compute and storage
* Enables customers to start small and scale seamlessly
* Offers a range of storage options for various performance and cost pointsNetApp ONTAP AI offers converged infrastructure stacks incorporating NVIDIA DGX-1, a petaflop-scale AI system, and NVIDIA Mellanox high-performance Ethernet switches to unify AI workloads, simplify deployment, and accelerate ROI. We leveraged ONTAP AI with one DGX-1 and NetApp AFF A800 storage system for this technical report. The following image shows the topology of ONTAP AI with the DGX-1 system used in this validation.

== NetApp AI Control Plane

The NetApp AI Control Plane enables you to unleash AI and ML with a solution that offers extreme scalability, streamlined deployment, and nonstop data availability. The AI Control Plane solution integrates Kubernetes and Kubeflow with a data fabric enabled by NetApp. Kubernetes, the industry-standard container orchestration platform for cloud-native deployments, enables workload scalability and portability. Kubeflow is an open-source machine-learning platform that simplifies management and deployment, enabling developers to do more data science in less time. A data fabric enabled by NetApp offers uncompromising data availability and portability to make sure that your data is accessible across the pipeline, from edge to core to cloud. This technical report uses the NetApp AI Control Plane in an MLRun pipeline. The following image shows Kubernetes cluster management page where you can have different endpoints for each cluster. We connected NFS Persistent Volumes to the Kubernetes cluster, and the following images show an Persistent Volume connected to the cluster, where https://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-netapp-project-trident.pdf[NetApp Trident^] offers persistent storage support and data management capabilities.

== Iguazio Overview

The Iguazio Data Science Platform is a fully integrated and secure data- science platform as a service (PaaS) that simplifies development, accelerates performance, facilitates collaboration, and addresses operational challenges. This platform incorporates the following components, and the Iguazio Data Science Platform is presented in the following image:

* A data-science workbench that includes Jupyter Notebooks, integrated analytics engines, and Python packages
* Model management with experiments tracking and automated pipeline capabilities
* Managed data and ML services over a scalable Kubernetes cluster
* Nuclio, a real-time serverless functions framework
* An extremely fast and secure data layer that supports SQL, NoSQL, time-series databases, files (simple objects), and streaming
* Integration with third-party data sources such as NetApp, Amazon S3, HDFS, SQL databases, and streaming or messaging protocols
* Real-time dashboards based on Grafana
