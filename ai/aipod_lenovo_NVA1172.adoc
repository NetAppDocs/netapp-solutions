This reference architecture pairs NVIDIA-Certified OVX Lenovo ThinkSystem servers,
powered by NVIDIA L40S GPUs, with NVIDIA Spectrum networking to provide an optimal
infrastructure solution to optimize and deploy LLMs (Large Language models). The intent of
this document is to provide guidance relating to the storage for an OVX configuration. This
platform is suitable for various Generative AI workloads, including RAG (Retrieval Augmented
Generation), fine-tuning, and lightweight model training.
