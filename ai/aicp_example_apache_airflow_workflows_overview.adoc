The https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-data-science-toolkit/tree/main/Kubernetes[NetApp Data Science Toolkit for Kubernetes] can be used in conjunction with Airflow. Using the NetApp Data Science Toolkit with Airflow enables you to incorporate NetApp data management operations, such as creating snapshots and clones, into automated workflows that are orchestrated by Airflow.

Refer to the https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-dataops-toolkit/tree/main/netapp_dataops_k8s/Examples/Airflow[Airflow Examples] section within the NetApp Data Science Toolkit GitHub repository for details on using the toolkit with Airflow.
