To execute a synchronous multinode AI and ML job in your Kubernetes cluster, perform the following tasks on the deployment jump host. This process enables you to take advantage of data that is stored on a NetApp volume and to use more GPUs than a single worker node can provide. See the following figure for a depiction of a synchronous distributed AI job.

[NOTE]
Synchronous distributed jobs can help increase performance and training accuracy compared with asynchronous distributed jobs. A discussion of the pros and cons of synchronous jobs versus asynchronous jobs is outside the scope of this document.

. The following example commands show the creation of one worker that participates in the synchronous distributed execution of the same TensorFlow benchmark job that was executed on a single node in the example in the section link:aicp_execute_a_single-node_ai_workload.html[Execute a Single-Node AI Workload]. In this specific example, only a single worker is deployed because the job is executed across two worker nodes.
+
This example worker deployment requests eight GPUs and thus can run on a single GPU worker node that features eight or more GPUs. If your GPU worker nodes feature more than eight GPUs, to maximize performance, you might want to increase this number to be equal to the number of GPUs that your worker nodes feature. For more information about Kubernetes deployments, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[official Kubernetes documentation^].
+
A Kubernetes deployment is created in this example because this specific containerized worker would never complete on its own. Therefore, it doesn’t make sense to deploy it by using the Kubernetes job construct. If your worker is designed or written to complete on its own, then it might make sense to use the job construct to deploy your worker.
+
The pod that is specified in this example deployment specification is given a `hostNetwork` value of `true`. This value means that the pod uses the host worker node’s networking stack instead of the virtual networking stack that Kubernetes usually creates for each pod. This annotation is used in this case because the specific workload relies on Open MPI, NCCL, and Horovod to execute the workload in a synchronous distributed manner. Therefore, it requires access to the host networking stack. A discussion about Open MPI, NCCL, and Horovod is outside the scope of this document. Whether or not this `hostNetwork: true` annotation is necessary depends on the requirements of the specific workload that you are executing. For more information about the `hostNetwork` field, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/[official Kubernetes documentation^].

. Create a Kubernetes job for a master that kicks off, participates in, and tracks the execution of the synchronous multinode job. The following example commands create one master that kicks off, participates in, and tracks the synchronous distributed execution of the same TensorFlow benchmark job that was executed on a single node in the example in the section link:aicp_execute_a_single-node_ai_workload.html[Execute a Single-Node AI Workload].
+
This example master job requests eight GPUs and thus can run on a single GPU worker node that features eight or more GPUs. If your GPU worker nodes feature more than eight GPUs, to maximize performance, you might want to increase this number to be equal to the number of GPUs that your worker nodes feature.
+
The master pod that is specified in this example job definition is given a `hostNetwork` value of `true`, just as the worker pod was given a `hostNetwork` value of `true` in step 1. See step 1 for details about why this value is necessary.
