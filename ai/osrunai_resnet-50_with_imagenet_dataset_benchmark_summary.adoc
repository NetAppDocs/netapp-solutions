We validated the operation and performance of this system by using industry standard benchmark tools TensorFlow benchmarks. The ImageNet dataset used to train ResNet-50, which is a famous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) DL model for image classification. ResNet-50 delivers an accurate training result with a faster processing time, which enable us to drive a sufficient demand on the storage.
