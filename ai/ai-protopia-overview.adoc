Visual interpretations have become an integral part of communication with the emergence of image capturing and image processing. Artificial intelligence (AI) in digital image processing brings novel business opportunities, such as in the medical field for cancer and other disease identification, in geospatial visual analytics for studying environmental hazards, in pattern recognition, in video processing for fighting crime,  and so on. However, this opportunity also comes with extraordinary responsibilities.

The more decisions organizations put into the hands of AI, the more they accept risks related to data privacy and security and legal, ethical, and regulatory issues. Responsible AI enables a practice that allows companies and government organizations to build trust and governance that is crucial for AI at scale in large enterprises. This document describes an AI inferencing solution validated by NetApp under three different scenarios by using NetApp data management technologies with Protopia data obfuscation software to privatize sensitive data and reduce risks and ethical concerns.

Millions of images are generated every day with various digital devices by both consumers and business entities. The consequent massive explosion of data and computational workload makes businesses turn to cloud computing platforms for scale and efficiency. Meanwhile, privacy concerns over the sensitive information contained in image data arise with transfer to a public cloud. The lack of security and privacy assurances become the main barrier to deployment of image- processing AI systems.

Additionally, there is the https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/[right to erasure^] by the GDPR,  the right of an individual to request that an organization erase all their personal data. There is also the https://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacy-act-1974[Privacy Act^], which establishes a code of fair information practices. Digital images such as photographs can constitute personal data under the GDPR, which governs how data must be collected, processed, and erased. Failure to do so is a failure to comply with GDPR, which might lead to hefty fines for breaching compliances that can be seriously damaging to organizations. Privacy principles are among the backbone of implementing responsible AI that ensure fairness in the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) model predictions and lowers risks associated with violating privacy or regulatory compliance.

This document describes a validated design solution under three different scenarios with and without image obfuscation relevant to preserving privacy and deploying a responsible AI solution:

* *Scenario 1.* On-demand inferencing within Jupyter notebook.
* *Scenario 2.* Batch inferencing on Kubernetes.
* *Scenario 3.* NVIDIA Triton inference server.

For this solution, we use the Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark (FDDB), a dataset of face regions designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face detection, combined with the PyTorch machine learning framework for implementation of FaceBoxes. This dataset contains the annotations for 5171 faces in a set of 2845 images of various resolutions. Furthermore, this technical report presents some of the solution areas and relevant use cases gathered from NetApp customers and field engineers in situations where this solution is applicable.

== Target audience

This technical report is intended for the following audiences:

* Business leaders and enterprise architects who want to design and deploy responsible AI and address data protection and privacy issues concerning facial image processing in public spaces.
* Data scientists, data engineers, AI/ machine learning (ML) researchers, and developers of AI/ML systems who aim to protect and preserve privacy.
* Enterprise architects who design data obfuscation solutions for AI/ML models and applications that comply with regulatory standards such as GDPR, CCPA, or the Privacy Act of the Department of Defense (DoD) and government organizations.
* Data scientists and AI engineers looking for efficient ways to deploy deep learning (DL) and AI/ML/DL inferencing models that protect sensitive information.
* Edge device managers and edge server administrators responsible for deployment and management of edge inferencing models.

== Solution architecture

This solution is designed to handle real-time and batch inferencing AI workloads on large datasets by using the processing power of GPUs alongside traditional CPUs. This validation demonstrates the privacy-preserving inference for ML and optimal data management required for organizations seeking responsible AI deployments. This solution provides an architecture suited for a single or multi-node Kubernetes platform for edge and cloud computing interconnected with NetApp ONTAP AI at the core on-premises, NetApp DataOps Toolkit, and Protopia obfuscation software using Jupyter Lab and CLI interfaces. The following figure shows the logical architecture overview of data fabric powered by NetApp with DataOps Toolkit and Protopia.

Protopia obfuscation software runs seamlessly on top of the NetApp DataOps Toolkit and transforms the data before leaving the storage server.
