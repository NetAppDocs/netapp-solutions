Due to the number of calls that these support centers process, assessment of call performance could take significant time if performed manually. Traditional methods, like bag-of-words counting and other methods, can achieve some automation, but these methods do not capture more nuanced aspects and semantic context of dynamic language. AI modeling techniques can be used to perform some of these more nuanced analyses in an automated manner. Furthermore, with the current state of the art, pretrained modeling tools published by NVIDIA, AWS, Google, and others, an end-to-end pipeline with complex models can be now stood up and customized with relative ease.

An end-to-end pipeline for support center sentiment analysis ingests audio files in real time as employees converse with callers. Then, these audio files are processed for use in the speech-to-text component which converts them into a text format. Each sentence in the conversation receives a label indicating the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

Sentiment analysis can provide an essential aspect of the conversations for assessment of call performance. These sentiments add an additional level of depth to the interactions between employees and callers. The AI-assisted sentiment dashboard provides managers with a real-time tracking of sentiment within a conversation, along with a retrospective analysis of the employee’s past calls.

There are prebuilt tools that can be combined in powerful ways to quickly create an end-to-end AI pipeline to solve this problem. In this case, the NVIDIA RIVA library can be used to perform the two in-series tasks: audio transcription and sentiment analysis. The first is a supervised learning signal processing algorithm and the second is a supervised learning NLP classification algorithm. These out-of-the-box algorithms can be fine-tuned for any relevant use case with business-relevant data using the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit. This leads to more accurate and powerful solutions being built for only a fraction of the cost and resources. Customers can incorporate the https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine[NVIDIA Maxine^] framework for GPU-accelerated video conferencing applications in their support center design.

The following use cases are at the core of this solution. Both use cases use the TAO Toolkit for model fine-tuning and RIVA for model deployment.

* Speech-to-text
* Sentiment analysis

To analyze support center interactions between employees and customers, each customer conversation in the form of audio calls can be run through the pipeline to extract sentence-level sentiments. Those sentiments can then be verified by a human to justify the sentiments or adjust them as needed. The labeled data is then passed onto the fine-tuning step to improve sentiment predictions. If labeled sentiment data already exists, then model fine-tuning can be expedited. In either case, the pipeline is generalizable to other solutions that require the ingestion of audio and the classification of sentences.

AI sentiment outputs are either uploaded to an external cloud database or to a company- managed storage system. The sentiment outputs are transferred from this larger database into local storage for use within the dashboard that displays the sentiment analysis for managers. The dashboard’s primary functionality is to interface with the customer service employee in real time. Managers can assess and provide feedback on employees during their calls with live updates of the sentiment of each sentence, as well as an historic review of the employee’s past performance or customer reactions.

The link:https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-dataops-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.0.0[NetApp DataOps Toolkit^] can continue to manage data storage systems even after the RIVA inference pipeline generates sentiment labels. Those AI results can be uploaded to a data storage system managed by the NetApp DataOps Toolkit. The data storage systems must be capable of managing hundreds of inserts and selects every minute. The local device storage system queries the larger data storage in real-time for extraction. The larger data storage instance can also be queried for historical data to further enhance the dashboard experience. The NetApp DataOps Toolkit facilitates both these uses by rapidly cloning data and distributing it across all the dashboards that use it.

== Target Audience

The target audience for the solution includes the following groups:

* Employee managers
* Data engineers/data scientists
* IT administrators (on-premises, cloud, or hybrid)

Tracking sentiments throughout conversations is a valuable tool for assessing employee performance. Using the AI-dashboard, managers can see how employees and callers change their feelings in real time, allowing for live assessments and guidance sessions. Moreover, businesses can gain valuable customer insights from customers engaged in vocal conversations, text chatbots, and video conferencing. Such customer analytics uses the capabilities of multimodal processing at scale with modern, state-of-the-art AI models and workflows.

On the data side, a large number of audio files are processed daily by the support center. The NetApp DataOps Toolkit facilitates this data handling task for both the periodic fine-tuning of models and sentiment analysis dashboards.

IT administrators also benefit from the NetApp DataOps Toolkit as it allows them to move data quickly between deployment and production environments. The NVIDIA environments and servers must also be managed and distributed to allow for real time inference.
