This section focuses on the hardware components for the NetApp AIPod with NVIDIA DGX systems.

== NetApp AFF Storage Systems

NetApp AFF state-of-the-art storage systems enable IT departments to meet enterprise storage requirements with industry-leading performance, superior flexibility, cloud integration, and best-in-class data management. Designed specifically for flash, AFF systems help accelerate, manage, and protect business-critical data.

=== AFF A90 storage systems

The NetApp AFF A90 powered by NetApp ONTAP data management software provides built-in data protection, optional anti-ransomware capabilities, and the high performance and resiliency required to support the most critical business workloads. It eliminates disruptions to mission-critical operations, minimizes performance tuning, and safeguards your data from ransomware attacks. It delivers:
•	Industry-leading performance
•	Uncompromised data security
•	Simplified non-disruptive upgrades

==== Industry-leading Performance
The AFF A90 easily manages next-generation workloads like deep learning, AI, and high-speed analytics as well as traditional enterprise databases like Oracle, SAP HANA, Microsoft SQL Server, and virtualized applications. It keeps business-critical applications running at top speed with up to 2.4M IOPS per HA pair and latency as low as 100µs—and increases performance by up to 50% over previous NetApp models. With NFS over RDMA, pNFS and Session Trunking, customers can achieve the high level of network performance required for next-generation applications using existing data center networking infrastructure.
Customers can also scale and grow with unified multi-protocol support for SAN, NAS, and Object storage and deliver maximum flexibility with unified and single ONTAP data management software, for data on-premises or in the cloud. In addition, system health can be optimized with AI-based predictive analytics delivered by Active IQ and Cloud Insights.

==== Uncompromised Data Security
AFF A90 systems contain a full suite of NetApp integrated and application-consistent data protection software. It provides built-in data protection and cutting-edge anti-ransomware solutions for pre-emption and post-attack recovery. Malicious files can be blocked from ever being written to disk, and storage abnormalities are easily monitored to gain insights. 

==== Simplified Non-Disruptive Upgrades
The AFF A90 is available as a non-disruptive in-chassis upgrade to existing A800 customers. NetApp makes it simple to refresh and eliminate disruptions to mission-critical operations through our advanced reliability, availability, serviceability, and manageability (RASM) capabilities. In addition, NetApp further increases operational efficiency and simplifies day-to-day activities for IT teams because ONTAP software automatically applies firmware updates for all system components. 

For the largest deployments, AFF A1K systems offer the highest performance and capacity options while other NetApp storage systems, such as the AFF A70, and AFF C800  offer options for smaller deployments at lower cost points. 

== NVIDIA DGX BasePOD
NVIDIA DGX BasePOD is an integrated solution consisting of NVIDIA hardware and software components, MLOps solutions, and third-party storage. Leveraging best practices of scale-out system design with NVIDIA products and validated partner solutions, customers can implement an efficient and manageable platform for AI development. Figure 1 highlights the various components of NVIDIA DGX BasePOD.

Key specifications of the DGX H100 system are:
• Eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs.
• 80 GB GPU memory per GPU, for a total of 640GB.
• Four NVIDIA NVSwitch™ chips.
• Dual 56-core Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8480 processors with PCIe 5.0 support.
• 2 TB of DDR5 system memory.
• Four OSFP ports serving eight single-port NVIDIA ConnectX&#174;-7 (InfiniBand/Ethernet) adapters, and two dual-port NVIDIA ConnectX-7 (InfiniBand/Ethernet) adapters.
• Two 1.92 TB M.2 NVMe drives for DGX OS, eight 3.84 TB U.2 NVMe drives for storage/cache.
• 10.2 kW max power.
The rear ports of the DGX H100 CPU tray are shown below. Four of the OSFP ports serve eight ConnectX-7 adapters for the InfiniBand compute fabric. Each pair of dual-port ConnectX-7 adapters provide parallel pathways to the storage and management fabrics. The out-of-band port is used for BMC access.

NVIDIA Quantum-2 QM9700 switches with 400Gb/s InfiniBand connectivity power the compute fabric in NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand BasePOD configurations. ConnectX-7 single-port adapters are used for the InfiniBand compute fabric. Each NVIDIA DGX system has dual connections to each QM9700 switch, providing multiple high-bandwidth, low-latency paths between the systems.

==== NVIDIA Spectrum-3 SN4600 Switch

NVIDIA Spectrum&#8482;-3 SN4600 switches offer 128 total ports (64 per switch) to provide redundant connectivity for in-band management of the DGX BasePOD. The NVIDIA SN4600 switch can provide for speeds between 1 GbE and 200 GbE. For storage appliances connected over Ethernet, the NVIDIA SN4600 switches are also used. The ports on the NVIDIA DGX dual-port ConnectX-7 adapters are used for both in-band management and storage connectivity.

==== NVIDIA Spectrum SN2201 Switch
