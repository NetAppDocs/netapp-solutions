== NetApp AFF Storage Systems

NetApp AFF state-of-the-art storage systems enable IT departments to meet enterprise storage requirements with industry-leading performance, superior flexibility, cloud integration, and best-in-class data management. Designed specifically for flash, AFF systems help accelerate, manage, and protect business-critical data.

=== AFF A900 storage systems

The NetApp AFF A900 powered by NetApp ONTAP data management software provides built-in data protection, optional anti-ransomware capabilities, and the high performance and resiliency required to support the most critical business workloads. It eliminates disruptions to mission-critical operations, minimizes performance tuning, and safeguards your data from ransomware attacks. It delivers:
•	Industry-leading performance
•	Uncompromised data security
•	Simplified non-disruptive upgrades

==== Industry-leading Performance
The AFF A900 easily manages next-generation workloads like Deep Learning, AI, and high-speed analytics as well as traditional enterprise databases like Oracle, SAP HANA, Microsoft SQL Server, and virtualized applications. It keeps business-critical applications running at top speed with up to 2.4M IOPS per HA pair and latency as low as 100µs—and increases performance by up to 50% over previous NetApp models. With NFS over RDMA, pNFS and Session Trunking, you can achieve the high level of network performance required for next-generation applications using existing datacenter networking infrastructure.
You can also scale and grow with unified multi-protocol support for SAN, NAS, and Object storage and deliver maximum flexibility with unified and single ONTAP data management software, for data on-premises or in the cloud. In addition, you can optimize system health with AI-based predictive analytics delivered by Active IQ and Cloud Insights.

==== Uncompromised Data Security
AFF A900 systems contain a full suite of NetApp integrated and application-consistent data protection software. It provides built-in data protection and cutting-edge anti-ransomware solutions for pre-emption and post-attack recovery. You can block malicious files from being written to disk and monitor storage abnormalities to gain insights. 

==== Simplified Non-Disruptive Upgrades
The AFF A900 is available as a non-disruptive in-chassis upgrade to our existing A700 customers. We make it simple to refresh and eliminate disruptions to mission-critical operations through our advanced reliability, availability, serviceability, and manageability (RASM) capabilities. In addition, we further increase operational efficiency and simplify day-to-day activities for IT teams because ONTAP software automatically applies firmware updates. 

For the largest deployments, AFF A900 systems offer the highest performance and capacity options while other NetApp storage systems, such as the AFF A800, AFF A400, and AFF A250, offer options for smaller deployments at lower cost points. 

== NVIDIA DGX BasePOD
DGX BasePOD is an integrated solution consisting of NVIDIA hardware and software components, MLOps solutions, and third-party storage. Leveraging best practices of scale-out system design with NVIDIA products and validated partner solutions, customers can implement an efficient and manageable platform for AI development. Figure 1 highlights the various components of NVIDIA DGX BasePOD.

Key specifications of the DGX H100 system are:
• Eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs.
• 80 GB GPU memory.
• Four NVIDIA NVSwitch™ chips.
• Dual 56-core fourth Gen Intel® Xeon® capable processors with PCIe 5.0 support.
• 2 TB of DDR5 system memory.
• Four OSFP ports serving eight single-port NVIDIA ConnectX-7 VPI, three dual-port NVIDIA ConnectX-7 VPI.
• Two 1.92 TB M.2 NVMe drives for DGX OS, eight 3.84 TB U.2 NVMe drives for storage/cache.
• 11.3 kW max power.
The rear ports of the DGX H100 CPU tray are shown in Figure 7. Four of the OSFP ports serve eight ConnectX-7 HCAs for the InfiniBand compute fabric. Each pair of dual-port ConnectX-7 HCAs provide parallel pathways to the storage and management fabrics. The out-of-band port is used for BMC access.

NVIDIA QM9700 switches with NDR InfiniBand connectivity power the compute fabric in NDR BasePOD configurations. ConnectX-7 single-port adapters are used for the InfiniBand compute fabric. Each NVIDIA DGX system has dual connections to each QM9700 switch, providing multiple high-bandwidth, low-latency paths between 
the systems.

==== NVIDIA SN4600 Switch

NVIDIA SN4600 switches offer 128 total ports (64 per switch) to provide redundant connectivity for in-band management of the DGX BasePOD. The NVIDIA SN4600 switch can provide for speeds between 1 GbE and 200 GbE.For storage appliances connected over Ethernet, the NVIDIA SN4600 switches are also used. The ports on the NVIDIA DGX dual-port HCAs are used for both in-band management and storage connectivity.

==== NVIDIA SN2201 Switch
