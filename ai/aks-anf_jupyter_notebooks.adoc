summary: This solution follows the lifecycle of an AI/ML application. We start with the work of data scientists to define the different steps needed to prepare data and train models. By leveraging RAPIDS on Dask, we perform distributed training across the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to drastically reduce the training time when compared to the conventional Python scikit-learn approach. To complete the full cycle, we integrate the pipeline with Azure NetApp Files.
