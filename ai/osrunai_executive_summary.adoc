NetApp AFF storage systems deliver extreme performance and industry-leading hybrid cloud data-management capabilities. NetApp and Run:AI have partnered to demonstrate the unique capabilities of the NetApp ONTAP AI solution for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads that provides enterprise-class performance, reliability, and support. Run:AI orchestration of AI workloads adds a Kubernetes-based scheduling and resource utilization platform to help researchers manage and optimize GPU utilization. Together with the NVIDIA DGX systems, the combined solution from NetApp, NVIDIA, and Run:AI provide an infrastructure stack that is purpose-built for enterprise AI workloads. This technical report gives directional guidance to customers building conversational AI systems in support of various use cases and industry verticals. It includes information about the deployment of Run:AI and a NetApp AFF A800 storage system and serves as a reference architecture for the simplest way to achieve fast, successful deployment of AI initiatives.

The target audience for the solution includes the following groups:

* Enterprise architects who design solutions for the development of AI models and software for Kubernetes-based use cases such as containerized microservices
* Data scientists looking for efficient ways to achieve efficient model development goals in a cluster environment with multiple teams and projects
* Data engineers in charge of maintaining and running production models
* Executive and IT decision makers and business leaders who would like to create the optimal Kubernetes cluster resource utilization experience and achieve the fastest time to market from AI initiatives
