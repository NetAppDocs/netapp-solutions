This section includes references for additional information for the NetApp AIPod with NVIDIA DGX systems.

== Conclusion

The DGX BasePOD architecture is a next-generation deep learning platform that requires equally advanced storage and data management capabilities. By combining DGX BasePOD with NetApp AFF systems, the NetApp AIPod with DGX systems architecture can be implemented at almost any scale. Combined with the superior cloud integration and software-defined capabilities of NetApp ONTAP, AFF enables a full range of data pipelines that spans the edge, the core, and the cloud for successful DL projects.
