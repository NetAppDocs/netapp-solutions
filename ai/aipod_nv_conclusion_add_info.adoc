== Conclusion

The DGX BasePOD architecture is a next-generation deep learning platform that requires equally advanced storage and data management capabilities. By combining DGX BasePOD with NetApp AFF systems, the NetApp AIPod architecture can be implemented at almost any scale, from a single GPU in an OEM server paired with an AFF A250 storage system up to 48 DGX H100 systems on a 24-node AFF A900 cluster. Combined with the superior cloud integration and software-defined capabilities of NetApp ONTAP, AFF enables a full range of data pipelines that spans the edge, the core, and the cloud for successful DL projects.
