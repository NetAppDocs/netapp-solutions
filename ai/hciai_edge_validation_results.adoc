To run a sample inference request, complete the following steps:

. Get a shell to the client container/pod.
+

....
kubectl exec --stdin --tty <<client_pod_name>> -- /bin/bash
....

. Run a sample inference request.
+

....
image_client -m resnet50_netdef -s INCEPTION -u <<LoadBalancer_IP_recorded earlier>>:8000 -c 3 images/mug.jpg
....
+

image:hciaiedge_image24.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]
+

This inferencing request calls the `resnet50_netdef` model that is used for image recognition. Other clients can also send inferencing requests concurrently by following a similar approach and calling out the appropriate model.
