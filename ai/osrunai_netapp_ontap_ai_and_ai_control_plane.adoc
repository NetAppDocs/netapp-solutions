The NetApp ONTAP AI architecture, powered by NVIDIA DGX systems and NetApp cloud-connected storage systems. This reference architecture gives IT organizations the following advantages:

* Eliminates design complexities
* Enables independent scaling of compute and storage
* Enables customers to start small and scale seamlessly
* Offers a range of storage options for various performance and cost pointsNetApp ONTAP AI tightly integrates DGX systems and NetApp AFF A800 storage systems with state-of-the-art networking. NetApp ONTAP AI and DGX systems simplify AI deployments by eliminating design complexity and guesswork. Customers can start small and grow their systems in an uninterrupted manner while intelligently managing data from the edge to the core to the cloud and back.

NetApp AI Control Plane is a full stack AI, ML, and deep learning (DL) data and experiment management solution for data scientists and data engineers. As organizations increase their use of AI, they face many challenges, including workload scalability and data availability. NetApp AI Control Plane addresses these challenges through functionalities, such as rapidly cloning a data namespace just as you would a Git repo and defining and implementing AI training workflows that incorporate the near-instant creation of data and model baselines for traceability and versioning. With NetApp AI Control Plane, you can seamlessly replicate data across sites and regions and swiftly provision Jupyter Notebook workspaces with access to massive datasets.
