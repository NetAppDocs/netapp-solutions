This section focuses on the architecture for the NetApp AIPod with NVIDIA DGX systems.

== NetApp AIPod with DGX systems
This reference architecture leverages separate fabrics for compute cluster interconnect and storage access, with 400Gb/s InfiniBand (IB) connectivity between compute nodes. The drawing below shows the overall solution topology of NetApp AIPod with DGX H100 systems.

== Network design

In this configuration the compute cluster fabric uses a pair of QM9700 400Gb/s IB switches, which are connected together for high availability. Each DGX H100 system is connected to the switches using eight connections, with even-numbered ports connected to one switch and odd-numbered ports connected to the other switch. 

For storage system access, in-band management and client access, a pair of SN4600 Ethernet switches is used. The switches are connected with inter-switch links and configured with multiple VLANs to isolate the various traffic types. Basic L3 routing is enabled between specific VLANs to enable multiple paths between client and storage interfaces on the same switch as well as between switches for high availability. For larger deployments the Ethernet network can be expanded to a leaf-spine configuration by adding additional switch pairs for spine switches and additional leaves as needed. 

In addition to the compute interconnect and high-speed Ethernet networks, all of the physical devices are also connected to one or more SN2201 Ethernet switches for out of band management. Please see the link:ai/aipod_nv_deployment.html[deployment details] page for more information on network configuration.   

== Storage access overview for DGX H100 systems

Each DGX H100 system is provisioned with two dual-ported ConnectX-7 adapters for management and storage traffic, and for this solution both ports on each card are connected to the same switch. One port from each card is then configured into a LACP MLAG bond with one port connected to each switch, and VLANs for in-band management, client access, and user-level storage access are hosted on this bond. 

The other port on each card is used for connectivity to the AFF A90 storage systems, and can be used in several configurations depending on workload requirements. For configurations using NFS over RDMA to support NVIDIA Magnum IO GPUDirect Storage, the ports are used individually with IP addresses in separate VLANs. For deployments that do not require RDMA, the storage interfaces can also be configured with LACP bonding to deliver high availability and additional bandwidth. With or without RDMA, clients can mount the storage system using NFS v4.1 pNFS and Session trunking to enable parallel access to all storage nodes in the cluster. Please see the link:ai/aipod_nv_deployment.html[deployment details] page for more information on client configuration.

== Storage system design
Each AFF A90 storage system is connected using six 200 GbE ports from each controller. Four ports from each controller are used for workload data access from the DGX systems, and two ports from each controller are configured as an LACP interface group to support access from the management plane servers for cluster management artifacts and user home directories. All data access from the storage system is provided through NFS, with a storage virtual machine (SVM) dedicated to AI workload access and a separate SVM dedicated to cluster management uses. 

Please see the link:ai/aipod_nv_deployment.html[deployment details] page for more information on storage system configuration.

== Management plane servers

This reference architecture also includes five CPU-based servers for management plane uses. Two of these systems are used as the head nodes for NVIDIA Base Command Manager for cluster deployment and management. The other three systems are used to provide additional cluster services such as Kubernetes master nodes or login nodes for deployments utilizing Slurm for job scheduling. Deployments utilizing Kubernetes can leverage the NetApp Astra Trident CSI driver to provide automated provisioning and data services with persistent storage for both management and AI workloads on the AFF A900 storage system. 

Each server is physically connected to both the IB switches and Ethernet switches to enable cluster deployment and management, and configured with NFS mounts to the storage system via the management SVM for storage of cluster management artifacts as described earlier.
