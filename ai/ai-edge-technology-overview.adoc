== NetApp ONTAP 9

ONTAP 9.8.1, the latest generation of storage management software from NetApp, enables businesses to modernize infrastructure and transition to a cloud-ready data center. Leveraging industry-leading data management capabilities, ONTAP enables the management and protection of data with a single set of tools, regardless of where that data resides. You can also move data freely to wherever it is needed: the edge, the core, or the cloud. ONTAP 9.8.1 includes numerous features that simplify data management, accelerate and protect critical data, and enable next generation infrastructure capabilities across hybrid cloud architectures.

=== Simplify data management

Data management is crucial to enterprise IT operations so that appropriate resources are used for applications and datasets. ONTAP includes the following features to streamline and simplify operations and reduce the total cost of operation:

* *Inline data compaction and expanded deduplication.* Data compaction reduces wasted space inside storage blocks, and deduplication significantly increases effective capacity. This applies to data stored locally and data tiered to the cloud.
* *Minimum, maximum, and adaptive quality of service (AQoS).* Granular quality of service (QoS) controls help maintain performance levels for critical applications in highly shared environments.
* *NetApp FabricPool.* This feature provides automatic tiering of cold data to public and private cloud storage options, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and NetApp StorageGRID storage solution. For more information about FabricPool, see link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/17239-tr4598pdf.pdf[TR-4598^].

=== Accelerate and protect data

ONTAP 9 delivers superior levels of performance and data protection and extends these capabilities in the following ways:

* *Performance and lower latency.*  ONTAP offers the highest possible throughput at the lowest possible latency.
* *Data protection.* ONTAP provides built-in data protection capabilities with common management across all platforms.
* *NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE).* ONTAP offers native volume-level encryption with both onboard and External Key Management support.
* *Multitenancy and multifactor authentication.* ONTAP enables sharing of infrastructure resources with the highest levels of security.

=== Future-proof infrastructure

ONTAP 9 helps meet demanding and constantly changing business needs with the following features:

* *Seamless scaling and nondisruptive operations.* ONTAP supports the nondisruptive addition of capacity to existing controllers and to scale-out clusters. Customers can upgrade to the latest technologies, such as NVMe and 32Gb FC, without costly data migrations or outages.
* *Cloud connection.* ONTAP is the most cloud-connected storage management software, with options for software-defined storage (ONTAP Select) and cloud-native instances (NetApp Cloud Volumes Service) in all public clouds.
* *Integration with emerging applications.* ONTAP offers enterprise-grade data services for next generation platforms and applications, such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Industry 4.0, by using the same infrastructure that supports existing enterprise apps.

== NetApp Cloud Sync

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_cloud_sync.html[Cloud Sync^] is a NetApp service for rapid and secure data synchronization. Whether you need to transfer files between on-premises NFS or SMB file shares, NetApp StorageGRID, NetApp ONTAP S3, NetApp Cloud Volumes Service, Azure NetApp Files, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, or IBM Cloud Object Storage, Cloud Sync moves the files where you need them quickly and securely. After your data is transferred, it is fully available for use on both source and target. Cloud Sync continuously synchronizes the data, based on your predefined schedule, moving only the deltas, so time and money spent on data replication is minimized. Cloud Sync is a software as a service (SaaS) tool that is extremely simple to set up and use. Data transfers that are triggered by Cloud Sync are carried out by data brokers. You can deploy Cloud Sync data brokers in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or on-premises.

==== MLPerf

MLPerf is the industry-leading benchmark suite for evaluating AI performance. It covers many areas of applied AI including image classification, object detection, medical imaging, and natural language processing (NLP). In this validation, we used Inference v0.7 workloads, which is the latest iteration of the MLPerf Inference at the completion of this validation. The https://mlcommons.org/en/news/mlperf-inference-v07/[MLPerf Inference v0.7^] suite includes four new benchmarks for data center and edge systems:

* *BERT.* Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) fine-tuned for question answering by using the SQuAD dataset.
* *DLRM.* Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) is a personalization and recommendation model that is trained to optimize click-through rates (CTR).
* *3D U-Net.* 3D U-Net architecture is trained on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset.
* *RNN-T.* Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that is trained on a subset of LibriSpeech. MLPerf Inference results and code are publicly available and released under Apache license. MLPerf Inference has an Edge division, which supports the following scenarios:

* *Single stream.* This scenario mimics systems where responsiveness is a critical factor, such as offline AI queries performed on smartphones. Individual queries are sent to the system and response times are recorded. 90th percentile latency of all the responses is reported as the result.
* *Multistream.* This benchmark is for systems that process input from multiple sensors. During the test, queries are sent at a fixed time interval. A QoS constraint (maximum allowed latency) is imposed. The test reports the number of streams that the system can process while meeting the QoS constraint.
* *Offline.* This is the simplest scenario covering batch processing applications and the metric is throughput in samples per second. All data is available to the system and the benchmark measures the time it takes to process all the samples.

Lenovo has published MLPerf Inference scores for SE350 with T4, the server used in this document. See the results at https://mlperf.org/inference-results-0-7/[https://mlperf.org/inference-results-0-7/] in the “Edge, Closed Division” section in entry #0.7-145.
