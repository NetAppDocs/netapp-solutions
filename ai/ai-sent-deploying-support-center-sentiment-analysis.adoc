Deploying the solution involves the following components:

. NetApp DataOps Toolkit
. NGC Configuration
. NVIDIA RIVA Server
. NVIDIA TAO Toolkit
. Export TAO models to RIVA

To perform deployment, complete the following steps:

== NetApp DataOps Toolkit: Support center sentiment analysis

To use the https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-dataops-toolkit[NetApp DataOps Toolkit^], complete the following steps:

. Pip install the toolkit.
+
....
python3 -m pip install netapp-dataops-traditional
....

. Configure the data management
+
....
netapp_dataops_cli.py config
....

== NGC configuration: Support center sentiment analysis

To set up https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli[NVIDIA NGC^], complete the following steps:

. Download the NGC.
+
....
wget -O ngccli_linux.zip https://ngc.nvidia.com/downloads/ngccli_linux.zip && unzip -o ngccli_linux.zip && chmod u+x ngc
....

. Add your current directory to path.
+
....
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:$(pwd)\"" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
....

. You must configure NGC CLI for your use so that you can run the commands. Enter the following command, including your API key when prompted.
+
....
ngc config set
....

For operating systems that are not Linux-based, visit https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli[here^].

== NVIDIA RIVA server: Support center sentiment analysis

To set up https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/quick-start-guide.html[NVIDIA RIVA^], complete the following steps:

. Download the RIVA files from NGC.
+
....
ngc registry resource download-version nvidia/riva/riva_quickstart:1.4.0-beta
....

. Initialize the RIVA setup (`riva_init.sh`).
. Start the RIVA server (`riva_start.sh`).
. Start the RIVA client (`riva_start_client.sh`).
. Within the RIVA client, install the audio processing library ( https://ffmpeg.org/download.html[FFMPEG^])
+
....
apt-get install ffmpeg
....

. Start the https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Jupyter^] server.
. Run the RIVA Inference Pipeline Notebook.

== NVIDIA TAO Toolkit: Support center sentiment analysis

To set up NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, complete the following steps:

. Prepare and activate a https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[virtual environment^] for TAO Toolkit.
. Install the https://docs.nvidia.com/tao/tao-toolkit/text/tao_toolkit_quick_start_guide.html[required packages^].
. Manually pull the image used during training and fine-tuning.
+
....
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit-pyt:v3.21.08-py3
....

. Start the https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Jupyter^] server.
. Run the TAO Fine-Tuning Notebook.

== Export TAO models to RIVA: Support center sentiment analysis

To use https://docs.nvidia.com/tao/tao-toolkit/text/riva_tao_integration.html[TAO Toolkit models in RIVA^], complete the following steps:

. Save models within the TAO Fine-Tuning Notebook.
. Copy TAO trained models to the RIVA model directory.
. Start the RIVA server (`riva_start.sh`).

== Deployment roadblocks

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you develop your own solution:

* The NetApp DataOps Toolkit is installed first to ensure that the data storage system runs optimally.
* NVIDIA NGC must be installed before anything else because it authenticates the downloading of images and models.
* RIVA must be installed before the TAO Toolkit. The RIVA installation configures the docker daemon to pull images as needed.
* DGX and docker must have internet access to download the models.
