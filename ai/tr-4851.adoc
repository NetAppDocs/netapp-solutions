TR-4851 demonstrates the use of NetApp StorageGRID object storage as a data repository and management system for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) software development. This paper describes the data flow and requirements in autonomous vehicle software development and the StorageGRID features that streamline the data lifecycle. This solution applies to any multistage data pipeline workflow that is typical in ML and DL development processes.
