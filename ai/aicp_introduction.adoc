Companies and organizations of all sizes and across many industries are turning to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to solve real-world problems, deliver innovative products and services, and to get an edge in an increasingly competitive marketplace. As organizations increase their use of AI, ML, and DL, they face many challenges, including workload scalability and data availability. This solution demonstrates how you can address these challenges by pairing NetApp data management capabilities with popular open-source tools and frameworks.

This solution is intended to demonstrate several different open-source tools and frameworks that can be incorporated into an MLOps workflow. These different tools and frameworks can be used independently or in conjunction depending on the requirements and use case.

The following tools/frameworks are covered in this solution:

* link:https://airflow.apache.org[Apache Airflow]
* link:https://jupyter.org/hub[JupyterHub]
* link:https://www.kubeflow.org[Kubeflow]
* link:https://www.mlflow.org[MLflow]

The following list describes common patterns for deploying these tools independently or in conjunction.

* Deploy JupyterHub, MLflow, and Apache Airflow in conjunction - JupyterHub for link:https://jupyter.org[Jupyter Notebooks], MLflow for experiment tracking, and Apache Airflow for automated training and data pipelines.
* Deploy Kubeflow and Apache Airflow in conjunction - Kubeflow for link:https://jupyter.org[Jupyter Notebooks], experiment tracking, automated training pipelines, and inference; and Apache Airflow for data pipelines.
* Deploy Kubeflow as an all-in-one MLOps platform solution for link:https://jupyter.org[Jupyter Notebooks], experiment tracking, automated training and data pipelines, and inference.
