Although all applications today are not AI driven, they are evolving capabilities that allow them to access the immense benefits of AI. To support the adoption of AI, applications need an infrastructure that provides them with the resources needed to function at an optimum level and support their continuing evolution.

For AI-driven applications, edge locations act as a major source of data. Available data can be used for training when collected from multiple edge locations over a period of time to form a training dataset. The trained model can then be deployed back to the edge locations where the data was collected, enabling faster inferencing without the need to repeatedly transfer production data to a dedicated inferencing platform.

The NetApp HCI AI inferencing solution, powered by NetApp H615c compute nodes with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and NetApp cloud-connected storage systems, was developed and verified by NetApp and NVIDIA. NetApp HCI simplifies the deployment of AI inferencing solutions at edge data centers by addressing areas of ambiguity, eliminating complexities in the design and ending guesswork.
This solution gives IT organizations a prescriptive architecture that:

* Enables AI inferencing at edge data centers
* Optimizes consumption of GPU resources
* Provides a Kubernetes-based inferencing platform for flexibility and scalability
* Eliminates design complexities

Edge data centers manage and process data at locations that are very near to the generation point. This proximity increases the efficiency and reduces the latency involved in handling data. Many vertical markets have realized the benefits of an edge data center and are heavily adopting this distributed approach to data processing.

The following table lists the edge verticals and applications.
