== Domino Nexus

Domino Nexus is a single pane of glass that lets you run data science and machine learning workloads across any compute cluster — in any cloud, region, or on-premises. It unifies data science silos across the enterprise, so you have one place to build, deploy, and monitor models.

== NetApp BlueXP

NetApp BlueXP unifies all of NetApp’s storage and data services into a single tool that lets you build, protect, and govern your hybrid multicloud data estate. It delivers a unified experience for storage and data services across on-premises and cloud environments, and enables operational simplicity through the power of AIOps, with the flexible consumption parameters and integrated protection required for today’s cloud-led world.

== NetApp ONTAP

ONTAP 9, the latest generation of storage management software from NetApp, enables businesses to modernize infrastructure and transition to a cloud-ready data center. Leveraging industry-leading data management capabilities, ONTAP enables the management and protection of data with a single set of tools, regardless of where that data resides. You can also move data freely to wherever it is needed: the edge, the core, or the cloud. ONTAP 9 includes numerous features that simplify data management, accelerate, and protect critical data, and enable next generation infrastructure capabilities across hybrid cloud architectures.

=== Simplify data management

Data management is crucial to enterprise IT operations and data scientists so that appropriate resources are used for AI applications and training AI/ML datasets. The following additional information about NetApp technologies is out of scope for this validation but might be relevant depending on your deployment.

ONTAP data management software includes the following features to streamline and simplify operations and reduce your total cost of operation:

* Inline data compaction and expanded deduplication. Data compaction reduces wasted space inside storage blocks, and deduplication significantly increases effective capacity. This applies to data stored locally and data tiered to the cloud.
* Minimum, maximum, and adaptive quality of service (AQoS). Granular quality of service (QoS) controls help maintain performance levels for critical applications in highly shared environments.
* NetApp FabricPool. Provides automatic tiering of cold data to public and private cloud storage options, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and NetApp StorageGRID storage solution. For more information about FabricPool, see https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/17239-tr4598pdf.pdf[TR-4598: FabricPool best practices^].

=== Accelerate and protect data

ONTAP delivers superior levels of performance and data protection and extends these capabilities in the following ways:

* Performance and lower latency. ONTAP offers the highest possible throughput at the lowest possible latency.
* Data protection. ONTAP provides built-in data protection capabilities with common management across all platforms.
* NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE). ONTAP offers native volume-level encryption with both onboard and External Key Management support.
* Multitenancy and multifactor authentication. ONTAP enables sharing of infrastructure resources with the highest levels of security.

=== Future-proof infrastructure

ONTAP helps meet demanding and constantly changing business needs with the following features:

* Seamless scaling and nondisruptive operations. ONTAP supports the nondisruptive addition of capacity to existing controllers and to scale-out clusters. Customers can upgrade to the latest technologies, such as NVMe and 32Gb FC, without costly data migrations or outages.
* Cloud connection. ONTAP is the most cloud-connected storage management software, with options for software-defined storage and cloud-native instances in all public clouds.
* Integration with emerging applications. ONTAP offers enterprise-grade data services for next generation platforms and applications, such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Industry 4.0, by using the same infrastructure that supports existing enterprise apps.

== Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a first-party, fully managed AWS service that provides highly reliable, scalable, high-performing, and feature-rich file storage built on NetApp's popular ONTAP file system. FSx for ONTAP combines the familiar features, performance, capabilities, and API operations of NetApp file systems with the agility, scalability, and simplicity of a fully managed AWS service.

== NetApp Astra Trident

Astra Trident enables consumption and management of storage resources across all popular NetApp storage platforms, in the public cloud or on premises, including ONTAP (AFF, FAS, Select, Cloud, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP), Element software (NetApp HCI, SolidFire), Azure NetApp Files service, and Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud. Astra Trident is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) compliant dynamic storage orchestrator that natively integrates with Kubernetes.

== Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source, distributed, container orchestration platform that was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes enables the automation of deployment, management, and scaling functions for containerized applications, and is the dominant container orchestration platform in enterprise environments.

== Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service in the AWS cloud. Amazon EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes responsible for scheduling containers, managing application availability, storing cluster data, and other key tasks. With Amazon EKS, you can take advantage of all the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS infrastructure, as well as integrations with AWS networking and security services.
