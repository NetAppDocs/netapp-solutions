This section covers the technology requirements for the ONTAP AI solution.

== Hardware Requirements

Although hardware requirements depend on specific customer workloads, ONTAP AI can be deployed at any scale for data engineering, model training, and production inferencing from a single GPU up to rack-scale configurations for large-scale ML/DL operations. For more information about ONTAP AI, see the https://www.netapp.com/us/products/ontap-ai.aspx[ONTAP AI website^].

This solution was validated using a DGX-1 system for compute, a NetApp AFF A800 storage system, and Cisco Nexus 3232C for network connectivity. The AFF A800 used in this validation can support as many as 10 DGX-1 systems for most ML/DL workloads. The following figure shows the ONTAP AI topology used for model training in this validation.

To extend this solution to a public cloud, Cloud Volumes ONTAP can be deployed alongside cloud GPU compute resources and integrated into a hybrid cloud data fabric that enables customers to use whatever resources are appropriate for any given workload.

== Software Requirements

The following table shows the specific software versions used in this solution validation.

|===
|Component |Version

|Ubuntu
|18.04.4 LTS
|NVIDIA DGX OS
|4.4.0
|NVIDIA DeepOps
|20.02.1
|Kubernetes
|1.15
|Helm
|3.1.0
|cnvrg.io
|3.0.0
|NetApp ONTAP
|9.6P4
|===

For this solution validation, Kubernetes was deployed as a single-node cluster on the DGX-1 system. For large-scale deployments, independent Kubernetes master nodes should be deployed to provide high availability of management services as well as reserve valuable DGX resources for ML and DL workloads.
