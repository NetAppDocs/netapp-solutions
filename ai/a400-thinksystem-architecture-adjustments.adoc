== Storage capacity increase

Based on your storage capacity needs, you can increase the share storage (NFS volume) on demand by using the command `volume size â€“vserver <vserver name> -volume <volumename> -new-size +<size>GB`. You can do this from the CLI or from the NetApp web interface of the storage controller as admin user.
