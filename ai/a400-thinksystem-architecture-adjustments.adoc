The setup used for this validation can be adjusted to fit other use cases. 

== CPU Adjustments

We used a Skylake Intel Xeon Platinum 8360Y processor for this validation, as recommended by Lenovo. We expect that the equivalent Cascade Lake CPU, an Intel Xeon Gold 6330 processor, would deliver similar performance because this workload is not CPU bound. 

== Storage Capacity Increase 

Based on your storage capacity needs, you can increase the share storage (NFS volume) on demand, provided that you have the additional disk shelves and controller models. You can do this from the CLI or from the NetApp web interface of the storage controller as the admin user.
