The following sections provide details on the Run:AI installation, test scenarios, and results performed in this validation.

We validated the operation and performance of this system by using industry standard benchmark tools, including TensorFlow benchmarks. The ImageNet dataset was used to train ResNet-50, which is a famous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) DL model for image classification. ResNet-50 delivers an accurate training result with a faster processing time, which enabled us to drive a sufficient demand on the storage.
