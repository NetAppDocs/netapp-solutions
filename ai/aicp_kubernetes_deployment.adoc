This section describes the tasks that you must complete to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in which to implement the NetApp AI Control Plane solution. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, then you can skip this section as long as you are running a version of Kubernetes that is supported by Kubeflow and NetApp Trident. For a list of Kubernetes versions that are supported by Kubeflow, see the see the https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/[official Kubeflow documentation^]. For a list of Kubernetes versions that are supported by Trident, see the https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/[Trident documentation^].

For on-premises Kubernetes deployments that incorporate bare-metal nodes featuring NVIDIA GPU(s), NetApp recommends using NVIDIAâ€™s DeepOps Kubernetes deployment tool. This section outlines the deployment of a Kubernetes cluster using DeepOps.

== Prerequisites

Before you perform the deployment exercise that is outlined in this section, we assume that you have already performed the following tasks:

. You have already configured any bare-metal Kubernetes nodes (for example, an NVIDIA DGX system that is part of an ONTAP AI pod) according to standard configuration instructions.
. You have installed a supported operating system on all Kubernetes master and worker nodes and on a deployment jump host. For a list of operating systems that are supported by DeepOps, see the https://github.com/NVIDIA/deepops[DeepOps GitHub site^].

== Use NVIDIA DeepOps to Install and Configure Kubernetes

To deploy and configure your Kubernetes cluster with NVIDIA DeepOps, perform the following tasks from a deployment jump host:

. Download NVIDIA DeepOps by following the instructions on the https://github.com/NVIDIA/deepops/tree/master/docs[Getting Started page^] on the NVIDIA DeepOps GitHub site.
. Deploy Kubernetes in your cluster by following the instructions on the https://github.com/NVIDIA/deepops/tree/master/docs/k8s-cluster[Kubernetes Deployment Guide page^] on the NVIDIA DeepOps GitHub site.
