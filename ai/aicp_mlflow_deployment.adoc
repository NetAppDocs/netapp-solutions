This section describes the tasks that you must complete to deploy MLflow in your Kubernetes cluster.

[NOTE]
It is possible to deploy MLflow on platforms other than Kubernetes. Deploying MLflow on platforms other than Kubernetes is outside of the scope of this solution.

== Prerequisites

Before you perform the deployment exercise that is outlined in this section, we assume that you have already performed the following tasks:

. You already have a working Kubernetes cluster.
. You have already installed and configured NetApp Trident in your Kubernetes cluster. For more details on Trident, refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/index.html[Trident documentation^].

== Install Helm

MLflow is deployed using Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. Before you deploy MLflow, you must install Helm on your Kubernetes control node. To install Helm, follow the https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[installation instructions^] in the official Helm documentation.

== Set Default Kubernetes StorageClass

Before you deploy MLflow, you must designate a default StorageClass within your Kubernetes cluster. To designate a default StorageClass within your cluster, follow the instructions outlined in the link:aicp_kubeflow_deployment_overview.html[Kubeflow Deployment] section. If you have already designated a default StorageClass within your cluster, then you can skip this step.

== Deploy MLflow

Once the pre-requisites have been met, you can start with MLflow deployment using the helm chart.


=== Configure MLflow Helm Chart Deployment.

Before we deploy MLflow using the Helm chart, we can configure the deployment to use NetApp Trident Storage Class and change other parameters to suit our needs using a *config.yaml* file. An example of *config.yaml* file can be found at: https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/mlflow/values.yaml

[NOTE]
You can set the Trident storageClass under the *global.defaultStorageClass* parameter in the config.yaml file (e.g. storageClass: "ontap-flexvol").

=== Installing the Helm Chart

The Helm chart can be installed with the custom *config.yaml* file for MLflow using the following command: 

[source, shell]
----
helm install oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/mlflow -f config.yaml --generate-name --namespace jupyterhub
----

[NOTE]
The command deploys MLflow on the Kubernetes cluster in the custom configuration via the provided *config.yaml* file. MLflow is deployed in the given namespace and a random release name is given via kubernetes for the release. 

=== Check Deployment
After the Helm chart is done deploying, you can check if the service is accessible using:

[source, shell]
----
kubectl get service -n jupyterhub
----
[NOTE]
Replace *jupyterhub* with the namespace you used during deployment.

You should see the following services:

[source, shell]
----
NAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
mlflow-1719843029-minio           ClusterIP   10.233.22.4     <none>        80/TCP,9001/TCP   25d
mlflow-1719843029-postgresql      ClusterIP   10.233.5.141    <none>        5432/TCP          25d
mlflow-1719843029-postgresql-hl   ClusterIP   None            <none>        5432/TCP          25d
mlflow-1719843029-tracking        NodePort    10.233.2.158    <none>        30002:30002/TCP   25d
----
[NOTE]
We edited the config.yaml file to use NodePort service to access MLflow on port 30002.

=== Access MLflow
Once all the services related to MLflow are up and running you can access it using the given NodePort or LoadBalancer IP address (e.g. `http://10.61.181.109:30002`)
