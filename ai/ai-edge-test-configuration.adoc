The following figure shows the test configuration. We used the NetApp AFF C190 storage system and two Lenovo ThinkSystem SE350 servers (each with one NVIDIA T4 accelerator). These components are connected through a 10GbE network switch. The network storage holds validation/test datasets and pretrained models. The servers provide computational capability, and the storage is accessed over NFS protocol.

This section describes the tested configurations, the network infrastructure, the SE350 server, and the storage provisioning details. The following table lists the base components for the solution architecture.

|===
|Solution components |Details

|Lenovo ThinkSystem servers
a|* 2x SE350 servers each with one NVIDIA T4 GPU card
|
a|* Each server contains one Intel Xeon D-2123IT CPU with four physical cores running at 2.20GHz and 128GB RAM
|Entry-level NetApp AFF storage system (HA pair)
a|* NetApp ONTAP 9 software
* 24x 960GB SSDs
* NFS protocol
* One interface group per controller, with four logical IP addresses for mount points

The /netappLenovo_AI_fg folder contains the datasets used for model validation.

The figure below shows the test configuration. We used the NetApp EF280 storage system and two Lenovo ThinkSystem SE350 servers (each with one NVIDIA T4 accelerator). These components are connected through a 10GbE network switch. The network storage holds validation/test datasets and pretrained models. The servers provide computational capability, and the storage is accessed over NFS protocol.

The following table lists the storage configuration for EF280.
