NetApp Solution Engineering

The NetApp&#8482; AIPod with NVIDIA DGX&#8482; systems and NetApp cloud-connected storage systems, simplifies infrastructure deployments for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads by eliminating design complexity and guesswork. Building on the NVIDIA DGX BasePOD design to deliver exceptional compute performance for next-generation workloads, AIPod with NVIDIA DGX systems adds NetApp AFF storage systems that allow customers to start small and grow non-disruptively while intelligently managing data from the edge to the core to the cloud and back. NetApp AIPod is part of the larger portfolio of NetApp AI solutions, show in the figure below-
