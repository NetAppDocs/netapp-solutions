== vSphere datastore and protocol features

Five protocols are used to connect VMware vSphere to datastores on a system running ONTAP software:

* FC
* FCoE
* NVMe/FC
* iSCSI
* NFS

FC, FCoE, NVMe/FC, and iSCSI are block protocols that use the vSphere Virtual Machine File System (VMFS) to store VMs inside ONTAP LUNs or namespaces that are contained in an ONTAP volume. Note that, starting from vSphere 7.0, VMware no longer supports software FCoE in production environments. NFS is a file protocol that places VMs into datastores (which are simply ONTAP volumes) without the need for VMFS. SMB, iSCSI, or NFS can also be used directly from a guest OS to ONTAP.

The following tables presents vSphere supported traditional datastore features with ONTAP. This information does not apply to vVols datastores, but it does generally applies to vSphere 6.x and 7.x releases using supported ONTAP releases. You can also consult https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/[VMware Configuration Maximums^] for specific vSphere releases to confirm specific limits.

*NetApp recommends using in-guest iSCSI for Microsoft clusters rather than multi- writer enabled VMDKs in a VMFS datastore. This approach is fully supported by Microsoft and VMware, offers great flexibility with ONTAP (SnapMirror to ONTAP systems on-premises or in the cloud), is easy to configure and automate, and can be protected with SnapCenter. vSphere 7 adds a new clustered VMDK option. This is different from multi-writer enabled VMDKs but requires a datastore presented via the FC protocol, which has clustered VMDK support enabled. Other restrictions apply. See VMware’s https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-70-setup-wsfc.pdf[Setup for Windows Server Failover Clustering^] documentation for configuration guidelines.

== Selecting a storage protocol

Systems running ONTAP software support all major storage protocols, so customers can choose what is best for their environment, depending on existing and planned networking infrastructure and staff skills. NetApp testing has generally shown little difference between protocols running at similar line speeds, so it is best to focus on your network infrastructure and staff capabilities over raw protocol performance.

The following factors might be useful in considering a choice of protocol:

* *Current customer environment.* Although IT teams are generally skilled at managing Ethernet IP infrastructure, not all are skilled at managing an FC SAN fabric. However, using a general-purpose IP network that’s not designed for storage traffic might not work well. Consider the networking infrastructure you have in place, any planned improvements, and the skills and availability of staff to manage them.
* *Ease of setup.* Beyond initial configuration of the FC fabric (additional switches and cabling, zoning, and the interoperability verification of HBA and firmware), block protocols also require creation and mapping of LUNs and discovery and formatting by the guest OS. After the NFS volumes are created and exported, they are mounted by the ESXi host and ready to use. NFS has no special hardware qualification or firmware to manage.
* *Ease of management.* With SAN protocols, if more space is needed, several steps are necessary, including growing a LUN, rescanning to discover the new size, and then growing the file system). Although growing a LUN is possible, reducing the size of a LUN is not, and recovering unused space can require additional effort. NFS allows easy sizing up or down, and this resizing can be automated by the storage system. SAN offers space reclamation through guest OS TRIM/UNMAP commands, allowing space from deleted files to be returned to the array. This type of space reclamation is more difficult with NFS datastores.
* *Storage space transparency.* Storage utilization is typically easier to see in NFS environments because thin provisioning returns savings immediately. Likewise, deduplication and cloning savings are immediately available for other VMs in the same datastore or for other storage system volumes. VM density is also typically greater in an NFS datastore, which can improve deduplication savings as well as reduce management costs by having fewer datastores to manage.

== Datastore layout

ONTAP storage systems offer great flexibility in creating datastores for VMs and virtual disks. Although many ONTAP best practices are applied when using the VSC to provision datastores for vSphere (listed in the section link:vsphere_ontap_recommended_esxi_host_and_other_ontap_settings.html[Recommended ESXi host and other ONTAP settings]), here are some additional guidelines to consider:

* Deploying vSphere with ONTAP NFS datastores results in a high-performing, easy-to-manage implementation that provides VM-to-datastore ratios that cannot be obtained with block-based storage protocols. This architecture can result in a tenfold increase in datastore density with a correlating reduction in the number of datastores. Although a larger datastore can benefit storage efficiency and provide operational benefits, consider using at least four datastores (FlexVol volumes) to store your VMs on a single ONTAP controller to get maximum performance from the hardware resources. This approach also allows you to establish datastores with different recovery policies.  Some can be backed up or replicated more frequently than others, based on business needs. Multiple datastores are not required with FlexGroup volumes for performance as it scales by design.
* NetApp recommends the use of FlexVol volumes and, starting with ONTAP 9.8 FlexGroup volumes,  NFS datastores. Other ONTAP storage containers such as qtrees are not generally recommended because these are not currently supported by ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere. Deploying datastores as multiple qtrees in a single volume might be useful for highly automated environments that can benefit from datastore-level quotas or VM file clones.
* A good size for a FlexVol volume datastore is around 4TB to 8TB. This size is a good balance point for performance, ease of management, and data protection. Start small (say, 4TB) and grow the datastore as needed (up to the maximum 100TB). Smaller datastores are faster to recover from backup or after a disaster and can be moved quickly across the cluster. Consider the use of ONTAP autosize to automatically grow and shrink the volume as used space changes. The ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere Datastore Provisioning Wizard use autosize by default for new datastores. Additional customization of the grow and shrink thresholds and maximum and minimum size can be done with System Manager or the command line.
* Alternately, VMFS datastores can be configured with LUNs that are accessed by FC, iSCSI, or FCoE. VMFS allows traditional LUNs to be accessed simultaneously by every ESX server in a cluster. VMFS datastores can be up to 64TB in size and consist of up to 32 2TB LUNs (VMFS 3) or a single 64TB LUN (VMFS 5). The ONTAP maximum LUN size is 16TB on most systems, and 128TB on All SAN Array systems. Therefore, a maximum size VMFS 5 datastore on most ONTAP systems can be created by using four 16TB LUNs. While there can be performance benefit for high-I/O workloads with multiple LUNs (with high-end FAS or AFF systems), this benefit is offset by added management complexity to create, manage, and protect the datastore LUNs and increased availability risk. NetApp generally recommends using a single, large LUN for each datastore and only span if there is a special need to go beyond a 16TB datastore. As with NFS, consider using multiple datastores (volumes) to maximize performance on a single ONTAP controller.
* Older guest operating systems (OSs) needed alignment with the storage system for best performance and storage efficiency. However, modern vendor-supported OSs from Microsoft and Linux distributors such as Red Hat no longer require adjustments to align the file system partition with the blocks of the underlying storage system in a virtual environment. If you are using an old OS that might require alignment, search the NetApp Support Knowledgebase for articles using “VM alignment” or request a copy of TR-3747 from a NetApp sales or partner contact.
* Avoid the use of defragmentation utilities within the guest OS, as this offers no performance benefit and affects storage efficiency and Snapshot copy space usage. Also consider turning off search indexing in the guest OS for virtual desktops.
* ONTAP has led the industry with innovative storage efficiency features, allowing you to get the most out of your usable disk space. AFF systems take this efficiency further with default inline deduplication and compression. Data is deduplicated across all volumes in an aggregate, so you no longer need to group similar operating systems and similar applications within a single datastore to maximize savings.
* In some cases, you might not even need a datastore. For the best performance and manageability, avoid using a datastore for high-I/O applications such as databases and some applications. Instead, consider guest-owned file systems such as NFS or iSCSI file systems managed by the guest or with RDMs. For specific application guidance, see NetApp technical reports for your application. For example, http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-3633.pdf[TR-3633: Oracle Databases on Data ONTAP^] has a section about virtualization with helpful details.
* First Class Disks (or Improved Virtual Disks) allow for vCenter-managed disks independent of a VM with vSphere 6.5 and later. While primarily managed by API, they can be useful with vVols, especially when managed by OpenStack or Kubernetes tools. They are supported by ONTAP as well as ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.

== Datastore and VM migration

When migrating VMs from an existing datastore on another storage system to ONTAP, here are some practices to keep in mind:

* Use Storage vMotion to move the bulk of your virtual machines to ONTAP. Not only is this approach nondisruptive to running VMs, it also allows ONTAP storage efficiency features such as inline deduplication and compression to process the data as it migrates. Consider using vCenter capabilities to select multiple VMs from the inventory list and then schedule the migration (use Ctrl key while clicking Actions) at an appropriate time.
* While you could carefully plan a migration to appropriate destination datastores, it is often simpler to migrate in bulk and then organize later as needed. If you have specific data protection needs, such as different Snapshot schedules, you might want to use this approach to guide your migration to different datastores.
* Most VMs and their storage may be migrated while running (hot), but migrating attached (not in datastore) storage such as ISOs, LUNs, or NFS volumes from another storage system might require cold migration.
* Virtual machines that need more careful migration include databases and applications that use attached storage. In general, consider the use of the application’s tools to manage migration. For Oracle, consider using Oracle tools such as RMAN or ASM to migrate the database files. See https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4534.pdf[TR-4534^] for more information. Likewise, for SQL Server, consider using either SQL Server Management Studio or NetApp tools such as SnapManager for SQL Server or SnapCenter.

== ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

The most important best practice when using vSphere with systems running ONTAP software is to install and use the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere plug-in (formerly known as Virtual Storage Console). This vCenter plug-in simplifies storage management, enhances availability, and reduces storage costs and operational overhead, whether using SAN or NAS. It uses best practices for provisioning datastores and optimizes ESXi host settings for multipath and HBA timeouts (these are described in Appendix B). Because it’s a vCenter plug-in, it’s available to all vSphere web clients that connect to the vCenter server.

The plug-in also helps you use other ONTAP tools in vSphere environments. It allows you to install the NFS Plug-In for VMware VAAI, which enables copy offload to ONTAP for VM cloning operations, space reservation for thick virtual disk files, and ONTAP Snapshot copy offload.

The plug-in is also the management interface for many functions of the VASA Provider for ONTAP, supporting storage policy-based management with vVols. After ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere is registered, use it to create storage capability profiles, map them to storage, and make sure of datastore compliance with the profiles over time. The VASA Provider also provides an interface to create and manage vVol datastores.

In general, NetApp recommends using the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere interface within vCenter to provision traditional and vVols datastores to make sure best practices are followed.

== General Networking

Configuring network settings when using vSphere with systems running ONTAP software is straightforward and similar to other network configuration. Here are some things to consider:

* Separate storage network traffic from other networks. A separate network can be achieved by using a dedicated VLAN or separate switches for storage. If the storage network shares physical paths such as uplinks, you might need QoS or additional uplink ports to make sure of sufficient bandwidth. Don’t connect hosts directly to storage; use switches to have redundant paths and allow VMware HA to work without intervention.
* Jumbo frames can be used if desired and supported by your network, especially when using iSCSI. If they are used, make sure they are configured identically on all network devices, VLANs, and so on in the path between storage and the ESXi host. Otherwise, you might see performance or connection problems. The MTU must also be set identically on the ESXi virtual switch, the VMkernel port, and also on the physical ports or interface groups of each ONTAP node.
* NetApp only recommends disabling network flow control on the cluster network ports within an ONTAP cluster. NetApp makes no other recommendations for best practices for the remaining network ports used for data traffic. You should enable or disable as necessary. See http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4182.pdf[TR-4182^] for more background on flow control.
* When ESXi and ONTAP storage arrays are connected to Ethernet storage networks, NetApp recommends configuring the Ethernet ports to which these systems connect as Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) edge ports or by using the Cisco PortFast feature. NetApp recommends enabling the Spanning-Tree PortFast trunk feature in environments that use the Cisco PortFast feature and that have 802.1Q VLAN trunking enabled to either the ESXi server or the ONTAP storage arrays.
* NetApp recommends the following best practices for link aggregation:
** Use switches that support link aggregation of ports on two separate switch chassis, using a multichassis link aggregation group approach such as Cisco’s Virtual PortChannel (vPC).
** Disable LACP for switch ports connected to ESXi unless using dvSwitches 5.1 or later with LACP configured.
** Use LACP to create link aggregates for ONTAP storage systems, with dynamic multimode interface groups with IP hash.
** Use IP hash teaming policy on ESXi.

*SVM LIFs connect to ports, interface groups, or VLAN interfaces that have VLAN, MTU, and other settings, but the settings are not managed at the SVM level.

**These devices have IP addresses of their own for management, but these addresses are not used in the context of ESXi storage networking.

== SAN (FC, FCoE, NVMe/FC, iSCSI), RDM

In vSphere, there are three ways to use block storage LUNs:

* With VMFS datastores
* With raw device mapping (RDM)
* As a LUN accessed and controlled by a software initiator from a VM guest OS

VMFS is a high-performance clustered file system that provides datastores that are shared storage pools. VMFS datastores can be configured with LUNs that are accessed using FC, iSCSI, FCoE, or NVMe namespaces accessed by the NVMe/FC protocol. VMFS allows traditional LUNs to be accessed simultaneously by every ESX server in a cluster. The ONTAP maximum LUN size is generally 16TB; therefore, a maximum-size VMFS 5 datastore of 64TB (see the first table in this section) is created by using four 16TB LUNs (All SAN Array systems support the maximum VMFS LUN size of 64TB). Because the ONTAP LUN architecture does not have small individual queue depths, VMFS datastores in ONTAP can scale to a greater degree than with traditional array architectures in a relatively simple manner.

vSphere includes built-in support for multiple paths to storage devices, referred to as native multipathing (NMP). NMP can detect the type of storage for supported storage systems and automatically configures the NMP stack to support the capabilities of the storage system in use.

Both NMP and NetApp ONTAP support Asymmetric Logical Unit Access (ALUA) to negotiate optimized and nonoptimized paths. In ONTAP, an ALUA-optimized path follows a direct data path, using a target port on the node that hosts the LUN being accessed. ALUA is turned on by default in both vSphere and ONTAP. The NMP recognizes the ONTAP cluster as ALUA, and it uses the ALUA storage array type plug-in (`VMW_SATP_ALUA`) and selects the round robin path selection plug-in (`VMW_PSP_RR`).

ESXi 6 supports up to 256 LUNs and up to 1,024 total paths to LUNs. Any LUNs or paths beyond these limits are not seen by ESXi. Assuming the maximum number of LUNs, the path limit allows four paths per LUN. In a larger ONTAP cluster, it is possible to reach the path limit before the LUN limit. To address this limitation, ONTAP supports selective LUN map (SLM) in release 8.3 and later.

SLM limits the nodes that advertise paths to a given LUN. It is a NetApp best practice to have at least one LIF per node per SVM and to use SLM to limit the paths advertised to the node hosting the LUN and its HA partner. Although other paths exist, they aren’t advertised by default. It is possible to modify the paths advertised with the add and remove reporting node arguments within SLM. Note that LUNs created in releases prior to 8.3 advertise all paths and need to be modified to only advertise the paths to the hosting HA pair. For more information about SLM, review section 5.9 of http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4080.pdf[TR-4080^]. The previous method of portsets can also be used to further reduce the available paths for a LUN.  Portsets help by reducing the number of visible paths through which initiators in an igroup can see LUNs.

* SLM is enabled by default. Unless you are using portsets, no additional configuration is required.

* For LUNs created prior to Data ONTAP 8.3, manually apply SLM by running the `lun mapping remove-reporting-nodes` command to remove the LUN reporting nodes and restrict LUN access to the LUN-owning node and its HA partner.

Block protocols (iSCSI, FC, and FCoE) access LUNs by using LUN IDs and serial numbers, along with unique names. FC and FCoE use worldwide names (WWNNs and WWPNs), and iSCSI uses iSCSI qualified names (IQNs). The path to LUNs inside the storage is meaningless to the block protocols and is not presented anywhere in the protocol. Therefore, a volume that contains only LUNs does not need to be internally mounted at all, and a junction path is not needed for volumes that contain LUNs used in datastores. The NVMe subsystem in ONTAP works similarly.

Other best practices to consider:

* Make sure that a logical interface (LIF) is created for each SVM on each node in the ONTAP cluster for maximum availability and mobility. ONTAP SAN best practice is to use two physical ports and LIFs per node, one for each fabric. ALUA is used to parse paths and identify active optimized (direct) paths versus active nonoptimized paths. ALUA is used for FC, FCoE, and iSCSI.
* For iSCSI networks, use multiple VMkernel network interfaces on different network subnets with NIC teaming when multiple virtual switches are present. You can also use multiple physical NICs connected to multiple physical switches to provide HA and increased throughput. The following figure provides an example of multipath connectivity. In ONTAP, configure either a single-mode interface group for failover with two or more links that are connected to two or more switches, or use LACP or other link-aggregation technology with multimode interface groups to provide HA and the benefits of link aggregation.
* If the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is used in ESXi for target authentication, it must also be configured in ONTAP using the CLI (`vserver iscsi security create`) or with System Manager (edit Initiator Security under Storage > SVMs > SVM Settings > Protocols > iSCSI).
* Use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to create and manage LUNs and igroups. The plug-in automatically determines the WWPNs of servers and creates appropriate igroups. It also configures LUNs according to best practices and maps them to the correct igroups.
* Use RDMs with care because they can be more difficult to manage,  and they also use paths, which are limited as described earlier. ONTAP LUNs support both https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2009226[physical and virtual compatibility mode^] RDMs.
* For more on using NVMe/FC with vSphere 7.0, see this https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sanhost/nvme_esxi_7.html[ONTAP NVMe/FC Host Configuration guide^] and http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4684.pdf[TR-4684^].The following figure depicts multipath connectivity from a vSphere host to an ONTAP LUN.

== NFS
// tag::nfs[]
vSphere allows customers to use enterprise-class NFS arrays to provide concurrent access to datastores to all the nodes in an ESXi cluster. As mentioned in the datastore section, there are some ease of use and storage efficiency visibility benefits when using NFS with vSphere.

The following best practices are recommended when using ONTAP NFS with vSphere:

* Use a single logical interface (LIF) for each SVM on each node in the ONTAP cluster. Past recommendations of a LIF per datastore are no longer necessary. While direct access (LIF and datastore on same node) is best, don’t worry about indirect access because the performance effect is generally minimal (microseconds).
* VMware has supported NFSv3 since VMware Infrastructure 3. vSphere 6.0 added support for NFSv4.1, which enables some advanced capabilities such as Kerberos security. Where NFSv3 uses client-side locking, NFSv4.1 uses server-side locking. Although an ONTAP volume can be exported through both protocols, ESXi can only mount through one protocol. This single protocol mount does not preclude other ESXi hosts from mounting the same datastore through a different version. Make sure to specify the protocol version to use when mounting so that all hosts use the same version and, therefore, the same locking style.  Do not mix NFS versions across hosts. If possible, use host profiles to check compliancy.
** Because there is no automatic datastore conversion between NFSv3 and NFSv4.1, create a new NFSv4.1 datastore and use Storage vMotion to migrate VMs to the new datastore.
** At the time that this report was written, NetApp is continuing to work with VMware to resolve problems with NFSv4.1 datastores and storage failover. We expect to resolve these issues shortly.
* NFS export policies are used to control access by vSphere hosts. You can use one policy with multiple volumes (datastores). With NFSv3, ESXi uses the sys (UNIX) security style and requires the root mount option to execute VMs. In ONTAP, this option is referred to as superuser, and when the superuser option is used, it is not necessary to specify the anonymous user ID.  Note that export policy rules with different values for `-anon` and `-allow-suid` can cause SVM discovery problems with the ONTAP tools. Here’s a sample policy:
** Access Protocol: nfs3
** Client Match Spec: 192.168.42.21
** RO Access Rule: sys
** RW Access Rule: sys
** Anonymous UID:
** Superuser: sys
* If the NetApp NFS Plug-In for VMware VAAI is used, the protocol should be set as `nfs` when the export policy rule is created or modified. The NFSv4 protocol is required for VAAI copy offload to work, and specifying the protocol as `nfs` automatically includes both the NFSv3 and the NFSv4 versions.
* NFS datastore volumes are junctioned from the root volume of the SVM; therefore, ESXi must also have access to the root volume to navigate and mount datastore volumes. The export policy for the root volume,  and for any other volumes in which the datastore volume’s junction is nested, must include a rule or rules for the ESXi servers granting them read-only access. Here’s a sample policy for the root volume, also using the VAAI plug-in:
** Access Protocol. nfs (which includes both nfs3 and nfs4)
** Client Match Spec. 192.168.42.21
** RO Access Rule. sys
** RW Access Rule. never (best security for root volume)
** Anonymous UID.
** Superuser. sys (also required for root volume with VAAI)
* Use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere (the most important best practice):
** Use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to provision datastores because it simplifies management of export policies automatically.
** When creating datastores for VMware clusters with the plug- in, select the cluster rather than a single ESX server.  This choice triggers it to automatically mount the datastore to all hosts in the cluster.
** Use the plug- in mount function to apply existing datastores to new servers.
** When not using ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, use a single export policy for all servers or for each cluster of servers where additional access control is needed.
* Although ONTAP offers a flexible volume namespace structure to arrange volumes in a tree using junctions, this approach has no value for vSphere. It creates a directory for each VM at the root of the datastore, regardless of the namespace hierarchy of the storage. Thus, the best practice is to simply mount the junction path for volumes for vSphere at the root volume of the SVM, which is how ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere provisions datastores. Not having nested junction paths also means that no volume is dependent on any volume other than the root volume and that taking a volume offline or destroying it, even intentionally, does not affect the path to other volumes.
* A block size of 4K is fine for NTFS partitions on NFS datastores. The following figure depicts connectivity from a vSphere host to an ONTAP NFS datastore.

== FlexGroup

ONTAP 9.8 adds support for FlexGroup datastores in vSphere, along with the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 9.8 release. FlexGroup simplifies the creation of large datastores and automatically creates a number of constituent volumes to get maximum performance from an ONTAP system. Use FlexGroup with vSphere for a single, scalable vSphere datastore with the power of a full ONTAP cluster.

In addition to extensive system testing with vSphere workloads, ONTAP 9.8 also adds a new copy offload mechanism for FlexGroup datastores. This uses an improved copy engine to copy files between constituents in the background while allowing access on both source and destination. Multiple copies use instantly available, space-efficient file clones within a constituent when needed based on scale.

ONTAP 9.8 also adds new file-based performance metrics (IOPS, throughput, and latency) for FlexGroup files, and these metrics can be viewed in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere dashboard and VM reports. The ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere plug-in also allows you to set Quality of Service (QoS) rules using a combination of maximum and/or minimum IOPS. These can be set across all VMs in a datastore or individually for specific VMs.

Here are some additional best practices that NetApp has developed:

* Use FlexGroup provisioning defaults. While ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere is recommended because it creates and mounts the FlexGroup within vSphere, ONTAP System Manager or the command line might be used for special needs. Even then, use the defaults such as the number of constituent members per node because this is what has been tested with vSphere.
* When sizing a FlexGroup datastore, keep in mind that the FlexGroup consists of multiple smaller FlexVol volumes that create a larger namespace. As such, size the datastore to be at least 8x the size of your largest virtual machine. For example, if you have a 6TB VM in your environment, size the FlexGroup datastore no smaller than 48TB.
* Allow FlexGroup to manage datastore space. Autosize and Elastic Sizing have been tested with vSphere datastores. Should the datastore get close to full capacity, use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere or another tool to resize the FlexGroup volume. FlexGroup keeps capacity and inodes balanced across constituents, prioritizing files within a folder (VM) to the same constituent if capacity allows.
* VMware and NetApp do not currently support a common multipath networking approach. For NFSv4.1, NetApp supports pNFS, whereas VMware supports session trunking. NFSv3 does not support multiple physical paths to a volume. For FlexGroup with ONTAP 9.8, our recommended best practice is to let ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere make the single mount, because the effect of indirect access is typically minimal (microseconds).  It’s possible to use round-robin DNS to distribute ESXi hosts across LIFs on different nodes in the FlexGroup, but this would require the FlexGroup to be created and mounted without ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere. Then the performance management features would not be available.
* FlexGroup vSphere datastore support has been tested up to 1500 VMs with the 9.8 release.
* Use the NFS Plug-In for VMware VAAI for copy offload. Note that while cloning is enhanced within a FlexGroup datastore, ONTAP does not provide significant performance advantages versus ESXi host copy when copying VMs between FlexVol and/or FlexGroup volumes.
* Use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 9.8 to monitor performance of FlexGroup VMs using ONTAP metrics (dashboard and VM reports), and to manage QoS on individual VMs. These metrics are not currently available through ONTAP commands or APIs.
* QoS (max/min IOPS) can be set on individual VMs or on all VMs in a datastore at that time. Setting QoS on all VMs replaces any separate per-VM settings. Settings do not extend to new or migrated VMs in the future; either set QoS on the new VMs or re-apply QoS to all VMs in the datastore.
* SnapCenter Plug-In for VMware vSphere release 4.4 supports backup and recovery of VMs in a FlexGroup datastore on the primary storage system. While SnapMirror may be used manually to replicate a FlexGroup to a secondary system, SCV 4.4 does not manage the secondary copies.
