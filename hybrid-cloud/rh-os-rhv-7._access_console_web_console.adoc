To access the console or web console, complete the following steps:

. To access the OCP cluster through the CLI, extract the `oc` command-line tools tar file and place its content in a directory that is in the user’s path.
+

....
[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ tar xvf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
README.md
oc
kubectl
[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin: /usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ cp oc /usr/local/bin
....

. To interact with the cluster through the CLI, you can use the `kubeconfig` file provided by the IPI process located in the `/auth` directory inside the folder from where you launched the installation program. To easily interact with the cluster, export the file that is created in the directory. After a successful cluster deployment, the file location and the following command are displayed.
+

....
[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ export KUBECONFIG=/home/user/openshift-deploy/auth/kubeconfig
....

. Verify whether you have access to the cluster and whether the nodes are in the Ready state.
+

....
[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ oc get nodes
