== About storage efficiencies

Although NetApp was the first to deliver deduplication for production workloads, this innovation wasnâ€™t the first or last one in this area. It started with ONTAP Snapshot copies, a space-efficient data protection mechanism with no performance effect, along with FlexClone technology to instantly make read/write copies of VMs for production and backup use. NetApp went on to deliver inline capabilities, including deduplication, compression, and zero-block deduplication, to squeeze out the most storage from expensive SSDs. Most recently, ONTAP added compaction to strengthen our storage efficiencies.

* *Inline zero-block deduplication.* Eliminates space wasted by all-zero blocks.
* *Inline compression.* Compresses data blocks to reduce the amount of physical storage required.
* *Inline deduplication.* Eliminates incoming blocks with existing blocks on disk.
*	*Inline data compaction.* Packs smaller I/O operations and files into each physical block.

You can run deduplication, data compression, and data compaction together or independently to achieve optimal space savings on a FlexVol volume. The combination of these capabilities has resulted in customers seeing savings of up to 5:1 for VSI and up to 30:1 for VDI.
