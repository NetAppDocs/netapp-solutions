To configure the worker nodes to run storage services, complete the following steps:

. To access storage from the Element system, each of the worker nodes must have iSCSI available and running as a service. To create a machine configuration that can enable and start the iscisd service, log in to the OCP web console and navigate to Compute > Machine Configs and click Create Machine Config. Paste the YAML file and click Create.

. After the configuration is created, it will take approximately 20–30 minutes to apply the configuration to the worker nodes and reload them.  Verify whether the machine config is applied by using `oc get mcp` and make sure that the machine config pool for workers is updated. You can also log in to the worker nodes to confirm that the iscsid service is running.

[NOTE]
It is also possible to confirm that the MachineConfig has been successfully applied and services have been started as expected by running the `oc debug` command with the appropriate flags.
