== Setting up Ansible Control nodes

Ansible is an agentless automation tool, so you only need to install it on one machine (Ansible control node). Through your control node, you can manage an entire fleet of remote machines without requiring any additional configuration on them.

Based on the type of OS you wish install Ansible on, click on one of the below links for detailed steps of setting up the control node:
