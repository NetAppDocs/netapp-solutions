[.lead]
This solution has been designed to be run in a Terraform environment.


== Pre-requisites
. Terraform >= 0.13
. Cloud Manager Account
. Cloud Provider Account – AWS, Azure
. Host machine (any OS supported by Terraform)

== Provider documentation
The documentation is available at: link:https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager/latest/docs[https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager/latest/docs]

=== Controlling the provider version
Note that you can also control the provider version. This is controlled by a required_providers block in your Terraform configuration.

The syntax is as follows:

[source, cli]
terraform {
  required_providers {
    netapp-cloudmanager = {
      source = "NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager"
      version = "20.10.0"
    }
  }
}
