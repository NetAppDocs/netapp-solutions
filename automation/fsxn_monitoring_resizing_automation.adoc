== Overview: Monitoring and auto-resizing FSxN Storage Capacity, Volumes and LUNs via AWS Lambda function

FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a first party enterprise-grade cloud storage service available on AWS that provides highly reliable, scalable, high-performing and feature-rich file storage built on the popular NetApp ONTAP file system. 

While it is easy to deploy and use FSxN, resizing the total storage capacity, volume size or LUN size requires manual intervention. This document provides a step by step guide to create an automated setup that monitors FSxN at regular intervals, resizes when a user-specified threshold is breached and notifies the end-user of the resizing activity.   


.Pre-requisites
[%collapsible]
=====
Before you begin, ensure that the following prerequisites are met: 

* FSxN is deployed
* A Private Subnet with a NAT gateway to a public subnet with an internet gateway attached is required by the lambda function
* The private subnet should also have connectivity to FSxN
* "fsxadmin" password has been set for FSxN
=====

.High Level Architecture
[%collapsible]
=====
* AWS Lambda Function makes API calls to FSxN for retrieving and updating the size of Storage Capacity, Volumes and LUNs. 
* "fsxadmin" password stored as secure string in AWS SSM Parameter Store for added layer of security.
* AWS SES (Simple Email Service) is used to notify end-users when a resizing event occurs.

== Solution Deployment

Follow the series of steps to complete the deployment of this solution:

.Step 1: Clone the git repository
[%collapsible]
=====
. Clone the GitHub repository on your local system:
+
----
git clone <repo-name-here>
----
=====

.Step 2: Create SSM parameter for fsxadmin password
[%collapsible]
=====
. Navigate to AWS Console > *Parameter Store* and click on *Create Parameter*. 
+
----
Name: <Any name/path for storing fsxadmin password>
Tier: Standard
Type: SecureString
KMS key source: My current account
  KMS Key ID: <Use the default one selected>
Value: <Enter the password for "fsxadmin" user configured on FSxN>
----
+
Click on *Create parameter*.

.Step 3: Setup Email Service
[%collapsible]
=====
. Navigate to AWS Console > *Simple Email Service (SES)* and click on *Create Identity*.
+
----
Identity type: Email address
Email address: <Enter an email address to be used for sending resizing notifications> 
----
+
Click on *Create identity*

.Step 4: Create and setup the AWS Lambda Function
[%collapsible]
=====
. Navigate to AWS Console > *AWS Lambda* and click on *Create function* in the same region as FSxN

. Use the default *Author from scratch* and update the following fields:
+
----
Function name: <Any name of your choice>
Runtime: Python 3.9
Architecture: x86_64
Permissions: Select "Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions"
Advanced Settings:
  Enable VPC: Checked
    VPC: <Choose either the same VPC as FSxN or a VPC that can access both FSxN and the internet via a private subnet>
    Subnets: <Choose 2 private subnets which have NAT gateway attached pointing to public subnets with internet gateway and subnets that have internet access>
    Security Group: <Choose a Security Group>
----
+
Click on *Create function*.

. Scroll down to the *Layers* section of the newly created Lambda function and click on *Add a layer*.

image:fsxn-monitoring-resizing-add-layer-button.png[This image depicts the add layer button on AWS Lambda function console.]

. Click on *create a new layer* under *Layer source*

. Create 2 Layers - 1 for Requests and 1 for Paramiko and upload *Requests.zip* and *Paramiko.zip* files. Select *Python 3.9* as the compatible runtime and click on *Create*.

image:fsxn-monitoring-resizing-create-layer-paramiko.png[This image depicts the Create New Layer window on AWS console.]

. Navigate back to AWS Lambda *Add Layer* > *Custom Layers* and add the paramiko and requests layer one after the other.

image:fsxn-monitoring-resizing-add-layer-window.png[This image depicts the add layer window on AWS Lambda function console.]

image:fsxn-monitoring-resizing-layers-added.png[This image depicts the added layers on AWS Lambda function console.]

. Navigate to the *Configuration* tab of the Lambda function and click on *Edit* under *General Configuration*. Change the Timeout to *5 mins* and click Save.

. Navigate to *Permissions* tab of the Lambda function and click on the role assigned. In the permissions tab of the role, click on *Add permissions* > *Create Inline policy*.
.. Click on the JSON tab and paste the contents of the file policy.json from the GitHub repo.
.. Replace every occurrence of ${AWS::AccountId} with your account ID and click on *Review Policy*
.. Provide a Name for the policy and click on *Create policy*

. Copy the contents of *fsxn_monitoring_resizing_lambda.py* from the git repo to *lambda_function.py* in the AWS Lambda function Code Source section.

. Create a new file in the same level as lambda_function.py and name it *vars.py* and copy the contents of vars.py from the git repo to the lambda function vars.py file. Update the variable values in vars.py and click on *Deploy*

image:fsxn-monitoring-resizing-lambda-code.png[This image depicts the lambda code on AWS Lambda function console.]

. Click on *Test*, create an empty test event and run the test and check if the script is running properly.

. Once tested successfully, navigate to *Configuration* > *Triggers* > *Add Trigger*.
+
----
Select a Source: EventBridge
Rule: Create a new rule
Rule name: <Enter any name>
Rule type: Schedule expression
Schedule expression: <Use "rate(1 day)" if you want the function to run daily or add your own cron expression>
----
+
Click on Add.

== Conclusion

We saw how easy it is to setup a monitoring solution that regularly monitors FSxN Storage Capacity, Volumes and LUNs and resizes them based on user-specified threshold and sends an email alert when resizing. This makes the process of using and monitoring FSxN seamless freeing up engineers to focus on business-critical activities while your storage grows automatically when you need it to.
