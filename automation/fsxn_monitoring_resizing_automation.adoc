== Overview: Monitoring and Auto-Resizing FSx for ONTAP via AWS Lambda function

FSx for ONTAP is a first-party enterprise-grade cloud storage service available on AWS that provides highly reliable, scalable, high-performing and feature-rich file storage built on the popular NetApp ONTAP file system. 

FSx for ONTAP provides a seamless deployment and management experience. No storage expertise is required to get started. To simplify monitoring, an AWS lambda function (to automate resizing of total storage capacity, volume size or LUN size based on threshold) can be used. Â This document provides a step-by-step guide to creating an automated setup that monitors FSx for ONTAP at regular intervals, notifies and resizes when a user-specified threshold is crossed and notifies the administrator of the resizing activity. 

.Features
[%collapsible]
=====
The solution provides the following features:

* Ability to monitor:
** Usage of overall Storage Capacity of FSx for ONTAP
** Usage of each volume (thin provisioned / thick provisioned)
** Usage of each LUN (thin provisioned / thick provisioned)
* Ability to resize any of the above when a user-defined threshold is breached
* Alerting mechanism to receive usage warnings and resizing notifications via email
* Ability to delete snapshots older than the user-defined threshold
* Ability to get a list of FlexClone volumes and snapshots associated
* Ability to monitor the checks at a regular interval
* Ability to use the solution with or without internet access
* Ability to deploy manually or using AWS CloudFormation Template
* Ability to monitor multiple FSx for ONTAP filesystems in a single VPC
=====

.Pre-requisites
[%collapsible]
=====
Before you begin, ensure that the following prerequisites are met: 

* FSx for ONTAP is deployed
* Private subnet with connectivity to FSx for ONTAP
* "fsxadmin" password has been set for FSx for ONTAP
=====

.High-Level Architecture
[%collapsible]
=====
* AWS Lambda Function makes API calls to FSx for ONTAP for retrieving and updating the size of Storage Capacity, Volumes and LUNs. 
* "fsxadmin" password stored as secure string in AWS SSM Parameter Store for an added layer of security.
* AWS SES (Simple Email Service) is used to notify end-users when a resizing event occurs.
* If deploying the solution in a VPC without internet access, VPC Endpoints for AWS SSM, FSx and SES are set up to allow Lambda to reach these services via AWS internal network.

.Step 1: Clone the GitHub repository
[%collapsible]
=====
Clone the GitHub repository on your local system:
----
git clone https://github.com/NetApp/fsxn-monitoring-auto-resizing.git
----
=====

.Step 2: Setup an AWS S3 bucket
[%collapsible]
=====

== Conclusion

With the provided solution, it is easy to set up a monitoring solution that regularly monitors FSx for ONTAP Storage, resizes it based on a user-specified threshold and provides an alerting mechanism. This makes the process of using and monitoring FSx for ONTAP seamless freeing up administrators to focus on business-critical activities while storage grows automatically when required.
