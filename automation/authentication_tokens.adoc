== AWS Authentication Requirements for CVO and Connector Using NetApp Cloud Manager

To configure automated Deployments of CVO and Connectors using Ansible playbooks via AWX/Ansible Tower, the following information is needed:

=== Acquiring Access/Secret Keys from AWS

. To deploy CVO and Connector in Cloud Manager, we need AWS Access/Secret Key. Acquire the keys in AWS console by launching IAM-->Users-->your username-->security credentials-->Create Access key.
. Copy access keys and keep them secured to use in Connector and CVO deployment.

NOTE: If you lose your key, you can create another access key and delete the one you lost

. Generate a refresh Token and save it for deployments.

=== Acquiring Client ID

. Access the API page to copy Client ID at https://services.cloud.netapp.com/developer-hub.
. Click on "learn How to Authenticate", in the top right corner.
. From the Authentication window that pops up, copy the Client ID from Regular Access if you require a username/password to login. Federated users with SSO should copy the client ID from the "Refresh Token Tab".

=== Acquiring Key Pair from AWS
