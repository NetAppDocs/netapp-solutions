----
.. Update the variable values in `vars/azure_anf.tfvars`.  
+
NOTE: You can choose to deploy the ANF volume using an existing vnet and subnet by setting the variable "vnet_creation_bool" and "subnet_creation_bool" value to false and supplying the "subnet_id_for_anf_vol". You can also set those values to true and create a new vnet and subnet in which case, the subnet ID will automatically be taken from the newly created subnet.


.. Initialize the Terraform repository to install all the pre-requisites and prepare for deployment.
