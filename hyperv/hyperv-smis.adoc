This paper documents how to install and manage NetApp SMI-S Provider, and provision storage with Microsoft SCVMM. 

== Introduction 

NetApp Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S) is a powerful tool for managing and monitoring storage systems. NetApp SMI-S leverages the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) protocols to provide a unified interface for various management tasks, including the handling of LUNs, volumes, CIMOM configuration settings, and CIM server users. More details, check link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/smis-provider[NetApp SMI-S Provider product document.]

==== Key features and benefits:
•	Storage system detection and management: detects storage systems running ONTAP software and provides tools to manage them effectively.
•	Simplified administration: simplifies the management of storage systems by providing a single command-based interface. 
•	Monitoring and reporting: offers robust monitoring and reporting features to keep track of storage elements and their performance.

== Get ready for SMI-S Provider deployment

A seamless integration with existing storage systems requires proper installation and configuration of the SMI-S Provider. 

* SMI-S Provider 5.2.7 supports Windows Server SCVMM 2025,2022,2019 & 2016 & Windows server 2025,2022,2019 & 2016. This release is not compatible with Windows Server 2012 or System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) 2012.
* NetApp SMI-S provider supports ONTAP 9.7 and later FAS and AFF systems.
* NetApp ONTAP ONE license covers all the SMI-S provider license requirements.

=== Install SMI-S Provider

Before you start the SMI-S provider deployment, you need to deploy

* Microsoft Hyper-V with SCVMM
* NetApp FAS or AFF storage system 
* Firewall port 5988 and 5989 should be open for SMI-S http and https connections to allow communication between the SMI-S Provider and SCVMM

It is important to understand the command-based interface to perform various management tasks, check link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/smis-provider/concept-smi-s-provider-commands-overview.html[NetApp SMI-S Provider commands.]

. Get SMI-S from NetApp download site and install on a supported version of Window server. 
. Verify SMI-S server is running.

=== Connect SMI-S Provider with SCVMM


. Expand “Fabric / Storage” in the navigator. Right click on Providers and click on “Add Storage Devices”. Select “SAN and NAS devices discovered and managed by a SMI-S provider”.

=== Provision with SCVMM with SMI-S Provider 

SCVMM uses the SMI-S Provider to interact with storage systems, allowing you to create and manage storage resources directly from SCVMM.

. In the SCVMM console, go to “Fabric”. Under “Storage”, right-click on “Classifications and Pools” and select “Create Logical Unit”. Choose the storage pool and classification. Provide the necessary details such as size, name, and description for the LUN.

== Logs and Traces
You can configure how SMI-S Provider manages log and trace files, such as specifying the levels of messages to be logged and the directory to which logs are saved. You also specify the components to be traced, the target to which trace messages are written, the level of tracing, and the trace file location.

==== Logs setting
By default, all system messages are logged and the system message logs are located in the logs directory in the directory in which NetApp SMI-S Provider is installed. You can change the location of and the level of system messages that are written to the CIM server log.

* Change the system message logging level, log Level: Trace, Information, Warning, Severe, Fatal
[source,shell]
====
cimconfig -s loglevel=new_log_level -p 
====


* Change the system message log directory
[source,shell]
====
cimconfig -s logdir=new_log_directory -p
====

==== Trace setting
