Sizing a cyber vault requires understanding how much data that will need to be restored in a given Recovery Time Objective.  Many factors play into properly designing a right sized cyber vault solution.

== Sizing considerations

=== Infrastructure
. What are the primary platform models (FAS v AFF A-Series v AFF C-Series)
. What is the bandwidth and latency between the primary and cyber vault?
. How large are the file sizes and how many files?

=== Recovery
. What is your recovery time objective?
. How much data do you need to be recovered within the RTO?

=== Replication
. How many SnapMirror fan-in relationships will the cyber vault be ingesting?
. Will SnapMirror be replicating to the vault during a recovery from a vault?
. Will there be single or multiple recoveries happening at the same time?
. Will those multiple recoveries be happening to the same primary?

//== Configurations
//Below are some example configurations demonstrating the RTO, cost and rack units of the different ONTAP based solutions.
