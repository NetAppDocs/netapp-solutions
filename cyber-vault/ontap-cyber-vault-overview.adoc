NetApp cyber vaulting for ONTAP, powered by SnapLock, provides organizations with a comprehensive and flexible solution for protecting their most critical data assets. By leveraging logical air-gapping with robust hardening methodologies for ONTAP, NetApp enables you to create secure, isolated storage environments that are resilient against evolving cyber threats. With NetApp, you can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data while maintaining the agility and efficiency of your storage infrastructure.

NOTE: Beginning in July 2024, content from technical reports previously published as PDFs has been integrated with ONTAP product documentation. In addition, new technical reports (TRs) such as this document will no longer be getting TR numbers.

Key features of NetApp reference architecture for cyber vaulting include: 

* Secure, isolated storage infrastructure (e.g., air gapped storage systems) 
* Backup copies of your data are both immutable and indelible
* Strict access controls and multi-factor authentication 
* Rapid data restoration capabilities 

You can use NetApp storage with ONTAP as an air-gapped cyber vault by leveraging link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/commit-snapshot-copies-worm-concept.html[SnapLock Compliance to WORM-protect Snapshot copies^]. You can perform all the basic SnapLock Compliance tasks on the Cyber vault. Once configured, Cyber vault volumes are automatically protected, eliminating the need to manually commit the Snapshot copies to WORM. More information on logical air-gapping can be found in this link:https://www.netapp.com/blog/ransomware-protection-snaplock/[blog^]

SnapLock Compliance is used to comply with the Banking and Financial regulations SEC 70-a-4(f), FINRA 4511(c), and CFTC 1.31(c)-(d).   It has been certified by Cohasset Associates to adhere to these regulations (audit report available upon request). By using SnapLock Compliance with this certification you get a hardened mechanism for air gapping of your data that is relied upon by the largest financial institutions in the world to ensure both retention and retrieval of banking records.
