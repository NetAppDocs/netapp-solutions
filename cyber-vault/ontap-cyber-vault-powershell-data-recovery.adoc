If data is destroyed in the production datacenter, the data from the cyber vault can be securely recovered to the chosen environment. Unlike a physically air-gapped solution, the air-gapped ONTAP cyber vault is built using native ONTAP features like SnapLock Compliance and SnapMirror. The result is a recovery process that is both fast and easy to execute.

In the event of ransomware attack and need for recovering from the cyber vault, the recovery process is simple and easy as the snapshot copies housed in the cyber vault are used to restore the encrypted data.

If the requirement is to provide a faster method of bringing data back online when necessary to quickly validate, isolate and analyze the data for recovery. This can be easily achieved by using with FlexClone with the snaplock-type option set to non-snaplock type.

[NOTE]
Starting with ONTAP 9.13.1, restore a locked Snapshot copy on the destination SnapLock volume of a SnapLock vault relationship can be instantly restored by creating a FlexClone with the snaplock-type option set to "non-snaplock." When executing the volume clone creation operation, specify the Snapshot copy as the "parent-snapshot." More information about creating a FlexClone volume with a SnapLock type link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/volumes/create-flexclone-task.html?q=volume+clone[here.]

[NOTE]
Practicing recovery procedures from the cyber vault will ensure the proper steps are established for connecting to the cyber vault and retrieving data. Planning and testing the procedure is essential for any recovery during a cyber-attack event.
